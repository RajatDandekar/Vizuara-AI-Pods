  "description": "**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe figure depicts a left-to-right, three-stage pipeline representing the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) process. Each stage is clearly delineated by a combination of distinct colored rectangular regions (soft sky blue, light sage green, and warm peach respectively) and descriptive titles above each stage. The background is a very light cream color. Rounded rectangles with subtle borders house the components within each stage. Clean, solid dark grey arrows illustrate the flow of data and processes between the stages.\n\n**Stage 1: Supervised Fine-tuning (Soft Sky Blue Region)**\n\n*   **Title:** \"Supervised Fine-tuning\" positioned above the stage, using a bold, clear, sans-serif font.\n*   **Component 1:** A rounded rectangle with a soft sky blue fill and a slightly darker blue border, labeled \"Language Model (LM)\" in the center of the stage using a sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle, a stylized icon representing a neural network.\n*   **Component 2:** A smaller rounded rectangle with a soft sky blue fill and a slightly darker blue border, to the left of the LM, labeled \"Labeled Data\" using a sans-serif font. This rectangle contains a stylized icon representing a dataset (e.g., stacked sheets of paper).\n*   **Connection 1:** A solid dark grey arrow with a medium line weight, originating from the \"Labeled Data\" rectangle and pointing towards the \"Language Model (LM)\" rectangle, indicating the flow of data used for fine-tuning. Label this arrow \"Fine-tuning\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Input:** A solid dark grey arrow originating from the left edge of the soft sky blue region, labeled \"Initial LM\" using a sans-serif font and pointing to the \"Language Model (LM)\" rectangle.\n\n**Stage 2: Reward Model Training (Light Sage Green Region)**\n\n*   **Title:** \"Reward Model Training\" positioned above the stage, using a bold, clear, sans-serif font.\n*   **Component 1:** A rounded rectangle with a light sage green fill and a slightly darker green border, labeled \"Reward Model (RM)\" in the center of the stage using a sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle, a stylized icon representing a scoring function.\n*   **Component 2:** Two rounded rectangles with a light sage green fill and a slightly darker green border, below the RM, side-by-side. One is labeled \"Model Output 1\" and the other \"Model Output 2\" using a sans-serif font. These represent two different outputs from the fine-tuned language model.\n*   **Component 3:** A stylized human figure (simple, line-art style) with two hands, one giving a thumbs-up and the other a thumbs-down. The figure is positioned between the Model Outputs and the Reward Model.\n*   **Connection 1:** Two solid dark grey arrows, each with a medium line weight, originating from \"Model Output 1\" and \"Model Output 2\" respectively, and pointing towards the human figure.\n*   **Connection 2:** A solid dark grey arrow with a medium line weight, originating from the human figure and pointing towards the \"Reward Model (RM)\" rectangle. Label this arrow \"Preference Rankings\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Input:** A solid dark grey arrow originating from the right edge of the soft sky blue region and pointing to both \"Model Output 1\" and \"Model Output 2\". Label this arrow \"LM Outputs\" using a sans-serif font.\n\n**Stage 3: PPO Optimization (Warm Peach Region)**\n\n*   **Title:** \"PPO Optimization\" positioned above the stage, using a bold, clear, sans-serif font.\n*   **Component 1:** A rounded rectangle with a warm peach fill and a slightly darker orange border, labeled \"Language Model (LM)\" in the center of the stage using a sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle, a stylized icon representing a neural network (same as Stage 1).\n*   **Component 2:** A rounded rectangle with a warm peach fill and a slightly darker orange border, to the right of the LM, labeled \"Environment\" using a sans-serif font. Inside the rectangle, a simple icon representing an environment.\n*   **Component 3:** A rounded rectangle with a warm peach fill and a slightly darker orange border, below the Language Model, labeled \"PPO Algorithm\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Connection 1:** A solid dark grey arrow with a medium line weight, originating from the \"Language Model (LM)\" and pointing towards the \"Environment\" rectangle. Label this arrow \"Action\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Connection 2:** A solid dark grey arrow with a medium line weight, originating from the \"Environment\" and pointing towards the \"PPO Algorithm\" rectangle. Label this arrow \"State\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Connection 3:** A solid dark grey arrow with a medium line weight, originating from the \"PPO Algorithm\" and pointing towards the \"Language Model (LM)\" rectangle. Label this arrow \"Update\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Connection 4:** A solid dark grey arrow originating from the right edge of the light sage green region (Reward Model) and pointing to the \"PPO Algorithm\" rectangle. Label this arrow \"Reward Signal\" using a sans-serif font.\n*   **Output:** A solid dark grey arrow originating from the right edge of the warm peach region, labeled \"Optimized LM\" using a sans-serif font.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   **Background:** Very light cream color.\n*   **Colors:** Soft sky blue for Stage 1, light sage green for Stage 2, and warm peach for Stage 3. All text is black. The arrows are a dark grey.\n*   **Line Weights:** Medium line weight for all arrows. Thin line weight for rectangle borders.\n*   **Font:** Clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) for all labels and annotations.\n*   **Icon Style:** Simple, clean line-art style for all icons.\n*   **Overall Aesthetic:** Clean, publication-ready, and emphasizing clarity and visual appeal. The diagram should be easy to understand at a glance.\n",
