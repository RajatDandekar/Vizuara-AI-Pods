  "description": "**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe figure depicts the OpenAI Gymnasium Lunar Lander environment. The lander descends toward the landing pad. The figure is divided into three sections, each in a labeled container: \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Rewards.\" These containers are arranged horizontally, with the Lunar Lander environment visually in the background, subtly behind the boxes. The background is a very light sky blue, suggesting the lunar sky.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Lunar Lander:** A stylized illustration of the Lunar Lander spacecraft. It descends toward a landing pad on the lunar surface. The lander is slightly transparent to allow the background lunar surface to show through, but remains distinct. Small engine flames fire from the engines (main, left, right) in a soft orange.\n\n2.  **Landing Pad:** A simple, rectangular landing pad on the lunar surface, visible beneath the lander.\n\n3.  **Action Space Container:** A rounded rectangle, positioned on the left, labeled \"Action Space\" in bold sans-serif font. The container has a dashed light gray border and a very light cream fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Action Space\" container, list the four discrete actions, each on a separate line, with numerical labeling (0, 1, 2, 3) in a readable sans-serif font:\n        *   \"0: Nothing\"\n        *   \"1: Left engine\"\n        *   \"2: Main engine\"\n        *   \"3: Right engine\"\n\n4.  **Observation Space Container:** A rounded rectangle, positioned in the center, labeled \"Observation Space\" in bold sans-serif font. The container has a dashed light gray border and a very light cream fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Observation Space\" box, list the eight observation values, each on a separate line, in a readable sans-serif font:\n        *   \"x position\"\n        *   \"y position\"\n        *   \"x velocity\"\n        *   \"y velocity\"\n        *   \"Angle\"\n        *   \"Angular velocity\"\n        *   \"Left leg contact\"\n        *   \"Right leg contact\"\n\n5.  **Reward Container:** A rounded rectangle, positioned on the right, labeled \"Rewards\" in bold sans-serif font. The box has a dashed light gray border and a very light cream fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Rewards\" container, list the reward values, each on a separate line, with clear positive/negative signs, in a readable sans-serif font:\n        *   \"+100: Landing\"\n        *   \"-100: Crash\"\n        *   \"+1 per leg contact\"\n        *   \"-0.03: Side engine\"\n        *   \"-0.3: Main engine\"\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   No arrows are needed.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   The \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Reward\" sections are visually separated by the rounded rectangle containers.\n*   The background lunar environment provides contextual grouping.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   The containers are labeled \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Rewards\" using a clear, bold sans-serif font.\n*   Each action, observation, and reward is labeled with its corresponding value or description using a clear sans-serif font.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   This figure primarily defines the environment, so there are no explicit inputs or outputs depicted.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   **Background:** Very light sky blue.\n*   **Containers:** Dashed light gray borders; very light cream fill.\n*   **Lunar Lander:** Stylized, slightly transparent illustration.\n*   **Text:** Clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n*   **Color Palette:** Muted, realistic colors for the lunar surface and lander. Soft orange for the engine flames.\n*   **Line Weights:** Thin lines for the container borders.\n*   **Icon Styles:** No icons are required.\n",
