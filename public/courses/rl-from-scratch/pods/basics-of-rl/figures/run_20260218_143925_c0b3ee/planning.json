  "initial_description": "Okay, I will generate a detailed description of an illustrative figure based on the provided methodology section and figure caption.\n\n**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe figure should depict the OpenAI Gymnasium Lunar Lander environment. The primary focus is the lander as it descends toward the landing pad. The figure is divided into three distinct sections, each enclosed in a clearly labeled box: \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Rewards.\" These boxes are arranged horizontally, with the Lunar Lander environment visually prominent in the background, subtly behind the boxes. The background is a very light pastel blue, suggesting the lunar sky.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Lunar Lander:** A stylized illustration of the Lunar Lander spacecraft. It should be shown descending toward a landing pad on the lunar surface. The lander can be slightly transparent to allow the background lunar surface to show through, but it should remain distinct. Small engine flames can be depicted firing from the engines (main, left, right).\n\n2.  **Landing Pad:** A simple, rectangular landing pad on the lunar surface. It should be clearly visible beneath the lander.\n\n3.  **Action Space Box:** A rectangular box, positioned on the left side of the figure, labeled \"Action Space.\" The box has a thin, solid black border and a very light gray fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Action Space\" box, list the four discrete actions:\n        *   \"0: Nothing\"\n        *   \"1: Left engine\"\n        *   \"2: Main engine\"\n        *   \"3: Right engine\"\n\n    *   Each action should be on a separate line, with clear numerical labeling (0, 1, 2, 3). Use a simple, readable font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n\n4.  **Observation Space Box:** A rectangular box, positioned in the center of the figure, labeled \"Observation Space.\" The box has a thin, solid black border and a very light gray fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Observation Space\" box, list the eight observation values:\n        *   \"x position\"\n        *   \"y position\"\n        *   \"x velocity\"\n        *   \"y velocity\"\n        *   \"Angle\"\n        *   \"Angular velocity\"\n        *   \"Left leg contact\"\n        *   \"Right leg contact\"\n\n    *   Each observation value should be on a separate line. Use a simple, readable font.\n\n5.  **Reward Box:** A rectangular box, positioned on the right side of the figure, labeled \"Rewards.\" The box has a thin, solid black border and a very light gray fill.\n\n    *   Inside the \"Rewards\" box, list the reward values:\n        *   \"+100: Landing\"\n        *   \"-100: Crash\"\n        *   \"+1 per leg contact\"\n        *   \"-0.03: Side engine\"\n        *   \"-0.3: Main engine\"\n\n    *   Each reward value should be on a separate line, with clear positive/negative signs. Use a simple, readable font.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   No arrows are needed in this diagram, as it primarily focuses on defining the environment's key components.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   The \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Reward\" sections are visually separated by the rectangular boxes.\n*   The background lunar environment provides contextual grouping.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   The boxes are labeled \"Action Space,\" \"Observation Space,\" and \"Rewards\" using a clear, sans-serif font.\n*   Each action, observation, and reward is clearly labeled with its corresponding value or description.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   This figure primarily defines the environment, so there are no explicit inputs or outputs depicted. However, implicitly, the action space can be considered the \"input\" to the environment, and the observation space and rewards are the \"outputs.\"\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   **Background:** Very light pastel blue to suggest the lunar sky.\n*   **Boxes:** Thin, solid black borders; very light gray fill.\n*   **Lunar Lander:** Stylized, slightly transparent illustration.\n*   **Text:** Clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial or Helvetica).\n*   **Color Palette:** Muted, realistic colors for the lunar surface and lander. Use a slightly brighter color (e.g., a soft orange) for the engine flames.\n*   **Line Weights:** Thin lines for the box borders and any connecting lines.\n*   **Icon Styles:** No icons are required. The text descriptions are sufficient.\n\nThis detailed description should provide enough information for someone to create a clear, informative, and visually appealing figure representing the Lunar Lander environment within the OpenAI Gymnasium framework.\n",
