  "description": "**Overall Layout:**\n\nThe figure will follow a top-to-bottom flow, illustrating the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The Router/Gating Network will be positioned at the top, directing input down to the Expert sub-networks arranged in parallel columns below. The activation of experts will be visually represented by highlighting only two out of eight experts, with the rest grayed out. A \"Sparse Activation\" label will be prominent.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1.  **Router (Gating Network):** A rounded rectangle at the top, labeled \"Router\". The box will have a soft sky blue fill and a slightly darker blue border. The text \"Router\" inside the box will be in bold sans-serif font. The router has one input arrow coming from the top (described below).\n\n2.  **Experts:** Eight identical rounded rectangles arranged in a horizontal row below the Router. They will be equally spaced and labeled \"Expert 1\", \"Expert 2\", \"...\", \"Expert 8\".\n\n    *   **Active Experts (2):** Two of the Expert boxes (e.g., Expert 2 and Expert 6) will have a warm peach fill and a slightly darker peach border. The text \"Expert 2\" and \"Expert 6\" inside these boxes will be in bold sans-serif font.\n\n    *   **Inactive Experts (6):** The remaining six Expert boxes will have a light gray fill and a slightly darker gray border. The text \"Expert 1\", \"Expert 3\", \"Expert 4\", \"Expert 5\", \"Expert 7\", \"Expert 8\" inside these boxes will be in sans-serif font, and dark gray.\n\n3.  **Input:** An arrow originating from the very top of the figure, pointing downwards to the \"Router\" box. The arrow will be black and have a closed arrowhead. The label \"Input Tokens\" will be placed above the arrow, in a sans-serif font, and black.\n\n4.  **Outputs:** Two arrows originating from the two active expert boxes (Expert 2 and Expert 6), pointing downwards and slightly outwards. These arrows will be the same color as the respective expert's border (darker peach), and have a closed arrowhead. These arrows will represent the output of the active experts. The label \"Output\" will be placed below the arrows, in a sans-serif font, and black.\n\n**Connections:**\n\n*   **Router to Experts:** Eight arrows originate from the \"Router\" box, each pointing downwards to one of the \"Expert\" boxes. These arrows will be thin, dashed, and light gray, visually representing the routing mechanism. Use bezier curves for a softer look.\n\n**Groupings:**\n\n*   A very faint, almost imperceptible, light gray rectangle can be placed behind all eight \"Expert\" boxes to visually group them. Use a dashed border for this grouping.\n\n**Labels and Annotations:**\n\n*   \"Router\" label inside the router box.\n*   \"Expert 1\", \"Expert 2\", \"...\", \"Expert 8\" labels inside the expert boxes.\n*   \"Input Tokens\" label above the input arrow.\n*   \"Output\" label below the output arrows.\n*   \"Sparse Activation\" label positioned to the right of the expert boxes, with a short arrow pointing towards the highlighted experts. The label will be in a sans-serif font, and black.\n\n**Input/Output:**\n\n*   Input: \"Input Tokens\" entering the Router.\n*   Output: \"Output\" from the active experts.\n\n**Styling:**\n\n*   **Background:** Pure white.\n*   **Color Palette:** Soft sky blue for the Router, warm peach for active Experts, and light gray for inactive Experts. Black and dark gray for text.\n*   **Arrow Style:** Closed arrowheads, consistent color scheme. Use a slightly thicker line for the main Input/Output arrows.\n*   **Font:** Sans-serif for all labels, with \"Router\" and \"Expert\" labels in bold.\n",
