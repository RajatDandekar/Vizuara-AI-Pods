    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the math, consider this thought experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a 16-frame video at 32×32 resolution. If you wanted every pixel to \"talk to\" every other pixel across all frames (full 3D attention), how many attention pairs would that be?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total positions: 16 × 32 × 32 = **16,384**\n",
    "- Attention pairs: 16,384² ≈ **268 million**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the factorized approach:\n",
    "- Spatial attention (per frame): 32 × 32 = 1,024 positions, repeated 16 times → 16 × 1,024² ≈ **16.8 million**\n",
    "- Temporal attention (per position): 16 frames, repeated 1,024 times → 1,024 × 16² ≈ **262,000**\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: ~**17 million** vs ~**268 million** — that is a **16× reduction**!\n",
    "\n",
    "The savings grow even more dramatically at higher resolutions. For a 256×256 video, the ratio is over **1000×**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✋ Stop and Think\n",
    "\n",
    "Before scrolling down, ask yourself:\n",
    "1. What information might we lose by factorizing? Can spatial-only attention capture an object moving across frames?\n",
    "2. Why do we do spatial attention first and temporal attention second (and not the other way)?\n",

    "### Self-Attention Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that self-attention computes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) \\cdot V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where Q (queries), K (keys), and V (values) are linear projections of the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this says: for each query position, compute a weighted sum over all value positions, where the weights are determined by the similarity between the query and each key, scaled by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ to prevent the dot products from becoming too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "For spatial attention, we reshape the video features of shape $(B, T, H, W, C)$ so that the **time axis is merged with the batch axis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{spatial}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(B \\cdot T) \\times (H \\cdot W) \\times C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each frame is processed independently. The sequence length is $H \\times W$ — the number of spatial positions in one frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means frame 1 attends only to itself, frame 2 attends only to itself, and so on. No cross-frame information flows during spatial attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "For temporal attention, we reshape so that the **spatial axes are merged with the batch axis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{temporal}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(B \\cdot H \\cdot W) \\times T \\times C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each spatial position $(h, w)$, we have a sequence of $T$ features across time. The attention lets each frame \"look at\" all other frames at that same spatial position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, the pixel at position $(3, 7)$ in frame 5 can attend to position $(3, 7)$ in frames 1, 2, 3, ..., T — but NOT to position $(10, 15)$ in any frame. This is the key restriction that makes it efficient.\n",

    "## 11. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why spatial first?** We do spatial attention before temporal attention. What would happen if we reversed the order? Would the model still work? Would training be different?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information bottleneck:** In factorized attention, a pixel at (3, 7) in frame 5 can only \"communicate\" with other frames through temporal attention at position (3, 7). What information might be lost? How could we mitigate this?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Causal vs bidirectional:** We implemented both causal and bidirectional temporal attention. When would you use each? Think about autoregressive generation vs. denoising.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling behavior:** As video resolution increases, which component becomes the bottleneck — spatial or temporal attention? What does this tell us about designing architectures for high-resolution video?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Alternating order:** Modify the factorized block to alternate — odd layers do spatial→temporal, even layers do temporal→spatial. Does this help?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local temporal attention:** Instead of attending to ALL frames, restrict temporal attention to a sliding window of ±3 frames. How does this affect quality vs speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-frame spatial attention:** Allow limited cross-frame communication in spatial attention by including features from adjacent frames as extra keys/values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Notebook 3, we will tackle two final pieces of the puzzle:\n",
    "- **Latent Video Diffusion:** Compressing videos with a VAE before running diffusion, for massive efficiency gains\n",
    "- **Diffusion Transformers (DiT):** Replacing the U-Net entirely with a Transformer using spacetime patches"
