But what happens when your model has so many layers that the total stack does not fit on a single GPU — even if each individual layer is small enough?\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why does 1F1B have lower peak memory than GPipe despite having the same bubble fraction?**\n",
    "   *Hint: Think about when activations are created and when they are released.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the minimum number of micro-batches needed to keep the bubble below 10% with 8 pipeline stages?**\n",
    "   *Hint: Solve $(P - 1) / (P - 1 + M) < 0.10$ for $M$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In practice, PP is used across nodes while TP is within a node. Why?**\n",
    "   *Hint: Think about communication frequency. PP communicates at stage boundaries (once per micro-batch per layer boundary). TP communicates within every single layer. Which one can tolerate higher latency?*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why do we split a mini-batch into micro-batches instead of just using a larger pipeline depth?**\n",
    "   *Hint: More stages means each stage does less work, which increases the relative cost of communication.*"

    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who want to go deeper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interleaved 1F1B**: In the interleaved schedule (used by Megatron-LM v3), each GPU handles *non-contiguous* stages. For example, with 8 stages and 4 GPUs, GPU 0 handles stages 0 and 4, GPU 1 handles stages 1 and 5, etc. This reduces the bubble by a factor of $v$ (the number of virtual stages per GPU). Try implementing this!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Accumulation**: Modify the training loop to accumulate gradients across micro-batches before updating weights. This is how real PP systems work — the optimizer step only happens once per mini-batch, not once per micro-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-Bubble Pipeline**: Recent research (Qi et al., 2024) proposes schedules that achieve near-zero bubble by overlapping the backward pass for weights (B) and the backward pass for activations (W). Read the paper and think about how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **PipeDream-2BW (Double-Buffered Weights)**: The original PipeDream maintained multiple versions of model weights to avoid stalls. PipeDream-2BW improved this by keeping at most 2 versions. How does this trade off memory for pipeline efficiency?"
