    "\n",
    "This series of notebooks takes you from zero to a complete RLHF pipeline. Each notebook builds on the previous one, and by the end, you will have implemented every major component of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Path\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 1: Reward Modeling\n",
    "**File:** `01_reward_modeling.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a reward model from scratch. Learn the Bradley-Terry preference model, implement the loss function, train on synthetic preference data, and verify the model learns to rank correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:** Bradley-Terry model, preference learning, pairwise comparisons, reward model architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 2: Policy Gradients and PPO\n",
    "**File:** `02_policy_gradients_and_ppo.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the optimization algorithms that power RLHF. Start with vanilla REINFORCE, understand its limitations, then build PPO with clipped surrogate objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:** Policy gradients, REINFORCE, importance sampling, PPO clipping, actor-critic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook 3: End-to-End RLHF Pipeline\n",
    "**File:** `03_end_to_end_rlhf.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Bring everything together. Take a pretrained GPT-2 model, define a sentiment reward signal, and use PPO with KL penalty to align the model. Compare outputs before and after RLHF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:** RLHF pipeline, KL penalty, reward hacking prevention, GPT-2 fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** 75 minutes\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic Python and PyTorch\n",
    "- Understanding of neural networks (forward/backward pass)\n",
    "- Familiarity with language models (helpful but not required)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "All notebooks are designed for Google Colab with a T4 GPU. Training completes in under 10 minutes per notebook."
