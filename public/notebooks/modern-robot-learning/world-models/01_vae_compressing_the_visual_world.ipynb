Trying to make decisions directly from 12,288 numbers is like trying to navigate a city by memorizing every single brick in every building. It is overwhelmingly detailed and computationally expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Core Idea: Compression and Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how a talented sketch artist works. Someone shows them a detailed photograph, and in seconds they capture the essence in a quick pencil sketch — the overall shape, the key features, the spatial relationships. That sketch is dramatically simpler than the photograph, but it contains all the information needed to understand the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE works the same way:\n",
    "1. The **Encoder** is the sketch artist — it looks at the full image and produces a tiny \"sketch\" (the latent code)\n",
    "2. The **Decoder** is like an artist who reconstructs the full image from just the sketch\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is what makes a VAE special compared to a regular autoencoder: the encoder does not output a single fixed sketch. Instead, it outputs a *probability distribution* — a cloud of possible sketches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we want the encoder to output a distribution instead of a single point?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Think about what happens when you try to compress similar but slightly different images. A photo of the digit \"7\" written with a slight lean versus a perfectly vertical \"7\" — should they map to the exact same latent code?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no. By outputting a distribution, the VAE acknowledges that compression is inherently uncertain. Slightly different inputs can map to overlapping regions in latent space, which means the latent space becomes *smooth* — nearby points decode to similar images. This smoothness is what allows us to interpolate between images later."

    "$$z = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$$\n",

    "This equation says: take the mean $\\mu$, then add some noise scaled by $\\sigma$. The noise $\\epsilon$ is sampled from a standard normal distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$z = 0.5 + 0.2 \\times 0.3 = 0.56$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this trick? During training, we need gradients to flow through the sampling operation. We cannot backpropagate through a random sample. But by rewriting the sample as $\\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon$, the randomness is isolated in $\\epsilon$ (which does not depend on any parameters), and gradients flow cleanly through $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Reconstruction loss**: How well does the decoded image $\\hat{x}$ match the original $x$? We use binary cross-entropy (BCE) for this.\n",
    "- **KL divergence**: How far is the encoder's distribution from a standard normal? This regularizer keeps the latent space well-organized.\n",

    "1. What happens if you increase the latent dimension from 16 to 64? Will reconstructions improve? What about interpolation?\n",
    "2. What happens if you remove the KL term entirely (set it to 0)? This gives you a regular autoencoder — will interpolation still work smoothly?\n",
    "3. Why is the KL term important for World Models specifically? (Hint: think about what the Memory component needs to do with the latent codes)\n",

    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Convolutional VAE**: Replace the fully-connected layers with convolutional layers. Do the reconstructions get sharper?\n",
    "2. **Conditional generation**: Modify the decoder to also take a digit label as input. Can you generate any digit on demand?\n",
    "3. **Beta-VAE**: Multiply the KL term by a factor $\\beta > 1$. How does this affect the latent space organization?\n",

    "We have built the \"eyes\" of our World Model — the VAE that compresses visual observations into a compact latent code. But seeing is not enough. The agent also needs to *predict* what will happen next. In the next notebook, we will build the **MDN-RNN** — the Memory component that learns the dynamics of the world in latent space."
