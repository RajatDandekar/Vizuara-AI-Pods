We will sample a random point from a standard normal distribution — pure noise — feed it through a neural network, and out comes a handwritten digit that looks like a human wrote it.\n",

    "## Section 2: Building Intuition — What Makes a VAE Different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write a single line of code, let us recap the three critical differences between a regular autoencoder and a VAE. Each one directly affects how we build the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference 1: Distributions, Not Points\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular autoencoder maps input $x$ to a single latent vector $z$. The encoder is deterministic — the same input always produces the same code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE encoder outputs two vectors: a mean $\\mu$ and a log-variance $\\log(\\sigma^2)$. Together, these define a Gaussian distribution in latent space. The same input maps to a *cloud* of possible latent codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture implication:** The encoder needs two output heads instead of one. We will build `fc_mu` and `fc_logvar` as separate linear layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference 2: The Reparameterization Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot backpropagate through a random sampling operation. If we just did `z = torch.randn(...)`, gradients would not flow from the decoder back to the encoder. The reparameterization trick separates the randomness from the learnable parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\mu + \\sigma \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The randomness is in $\\epsilon$, which has no learnable parameters. The encoder outputs ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) are deterministic functions of the input, so gradients flow through them normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture implication:** We need a `reparameterize` method that takes $\\mu$ and $\\log(\\sigma^2)$ and returns a sampled $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference 3: The ELBO Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular autoencoder minimizes reconstruction error alone. A VAE minimizes the **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)**, which has two terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = \\underbrace{\\text{BCE}(x, \\hat{x})}_{\\text{reconstruction}} + \\underbrace{D_{KL}(q(z|x) \\| p(z))}_{\\text{regularization}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reconstruction term asks: \"How well did we recreate the input?\" The KL term asks: \"How close is the encoder distribution to a standard normal?\" These two forces pull in opposite directions, and their balance determines the quality of the generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture implication:** Our loss function must compute and return both terms separately so we can monitor the balance during training."

    "## Section 3: The Mathematics for Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write down the three equations we will implement, focusing on the choices that matter for code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 The Encoder Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder defines a Gaussian posterior over the latent space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q(z|x) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x), \\text{diag}(\\sigma^2(x)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu(x)$ and $\\sigma^2(x)$ are neural network outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why log-variance instead of $\\sigma$ directly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a crucial design choice. The standard deviation $\\sigma$ must be positive. If we output $\\sigma$ directly, we would need to constrain the network output (e.g., with a softplus). Instead, we output $\\log(\\sigma^2)$, which can be any real number — positive or negative. To recover $\\sigma$, we compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\log(\\sigma^2)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is numerically stable because the exponential naturally ensures positivity, and operating in log-space avoids very large or very small variance values that could destabilize training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 The Reparameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\mu + \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\log(\\sigma^2)\\right) \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, this is just three lines. But those three lines are what make a VAE trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 The Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reconstruction loss** — We use Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) because MNIST pixels are values between 0 and 1. Our decoder outputs pixel probabilities through a sigmoid, and BCE measures how well these probabilities match the actual pixel values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{784} \\left[ x_i \\log(\\hat{x}_i) + (1 - x_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{x}_i) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**KL divergence** — For two Gaussians (our posterior vs. the standard normal prior), the KL divergence has a closed-form solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{KL}} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{d} \\left( 1 + \\log(\\sigma_j^2) - \\mu_j^2 - \\sigma_j^2 \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `reduction='sum'`?** We sum over all 784 pixels and all latent dimensions rather than averaging. This keeps the reconstruction and KL terms at comparable scales. If we averaged the reconstruction term (dividing by 784) but summed the KL term (over just 2 dimensions), the KL term would dominate and the model would ignore reconstruction entirely."

    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about what we have built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why log-variance and not variance directly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We output $\\log(\\sigma^2)$ instead of $\\sigma^2$ because the logarithm maps the positive-only variance to the full real line, which neural networks handle naturally. To recover $\\sigma$ for the reparameterization trick, we compute $\\exp(0.5 \\cdot \\log(\\sigma^2))$. This exponential guarantees positivity without any additional constraints. It also provides better numerical stability — very small and very large variances are represented equally well in log-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why does the KL term prevent posterior collapse... but also risk it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The KL term penalizes the encoder for deviating from the prior $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$. If the KL weight is too strong (or the decoder is too powerful), the encoder might find it easier to just output $\\mu = 0, \\log(\\sigma^2) = 0$ for every input, achieving zero KL. This is *posterior collapse* — the latent space carries no information, and the decoder must generate everything from scratch. Monitoring the KL loss during training helps catch this: if KL drops to near zero while reconstruction stays high, the model has collapsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why sum reduction instead of mean?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With `reduction='sum'`, the reconstruction loss sums over all 784 pixels, producing a large number. The KL loss sums over 2 latent dimensions, producing a smaller number. If we used `reduction='mean'` for reconstruction (dividing by 784), the KL term would be relatively much larger and would dominate. The sum keeps the two terms at natural scales where the model balances them well."
