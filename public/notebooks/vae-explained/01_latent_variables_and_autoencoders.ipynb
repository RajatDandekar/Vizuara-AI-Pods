    "\n",
    "How would you even begin?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that images are not random collections of pixels. Behind every face lies a **hidden recipe** — the shape of the jaw, the color of the eyes, whether the person is smiling. If we could somehow learn these hidden recipes, we could mix and match them to create entirely new faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hidden recipes are what we call **latent variables**, and learning to work with them is the foundation of some of the most powerful generative models in AI — including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which are the focus of this series.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Build intuition for what latent variables are using a simple thought experiment\n",
    "2. Build a regular (deterministic) autoencoder on handwritten digits\n",
    "3. Visualize its latent space and discover a critical flaw — the **dead zone problem**\n",
    "4. Understand why this flaw motivates the probabilistic approach we will explore in Notebook 2\n",

    "### The Cat Drawing Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you run a factory that produces cat drawings. Every drawing that rolls off the assembly line looks different — some cats are fat, some are skinny, some have pointy ears, some have round ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the crucial question: **what controls how each cat looks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind every cat drawing, there are *hidden factors* that determine its appearance:\n",
    "- **Body roundness**: How chubby is the cat? (scale of 0 to 1)\n",
    "- **Ear pointiness**: Are the ears sharp triangles or soft curves? (scale of 0 to 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two numbers — body roundness and ear pointiness — are the **latent variables**. We call them \"latent\" because they are *hidden*. You never observe them directly. You only see the final drawing (the pixels), not the recipe that produced it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now picture a 2D plane where the x-axis is \"body roundness\" and the y-axis is \"ear pointiness.\" Every possible cat drawing lives somewhere on this plane. A fat cat with pointy ears sits in the top-right corner. A skinny cat with round ears sits in the bottom-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 2D plane is the **latent space** — the space of all possible hidden recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the magic: if we could learn a machine that takes *any point* on this 2D plane and produces a convincing cat drawing, we could generate infinite new cats just by picking random points.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is exactly what autoencoders (and later, VAEs) try to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had to describe ANY cat drawing using just 2 numbers, what would those numbers represent? There is no single right answer — the point is that *some* compact description must exist, and we want our model to discover it automatically."

    "\n",
    "Now let us put some notation on these ideas. Do not worry — we will keep it simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{x}$ = the **observed data** (the image you can see — e.g., a 28x28 pixel image flattened into 784 numbers)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{z}$ = the **latent variables** (the hidden recipe — e.g., 2 numbers that capture the \"essence\" of the image)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **encoder** is a function that compresses the image into the hidden recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z} = f_{\\text{encoder}}(\\mathbf{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English: \"Give me an image, and I will tell you its hidden recipe.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The **decoder** is a function that reconstructs the image from the hidden recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = f_{\\text{decoder}}(\\mathbf{z})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English: \"Give me a hidden recipe, and I will draw you the image.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the encoder and decoder form an **autoencoder**. The training objective is simple: make the reconstructed image $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ as close as possible to the original image $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure \"closeness\" using the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{recon}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\| \\mathbf{x}_i - \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}_i \\|^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English: \"For each pixel, compute the squared difference between the original and the reconstruction, then average over all pixels.\" The lower this number, the better our reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our image is just 4 pixels: $\\mathbf{x} = [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2]$ and our reconstruction is $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = [0.85, 0.15, 0.75, 0.25]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[(0.9-0.85)^2 + (0.1-0.15)^2 + (0.8-0.75)^2 + (0.2-0.25)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{4}(0.01) = 0.0025$$\n",

    "## 11. Key Takeaways and What is Next\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us summarize what we have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "- An **autoencoder** with an encoder (784 -> 2) and a decoder (2 -> 784)\n",
    "- The encoder compresses images into a compact latent representation\n",
    "- The decoder reconstructs images from this representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Discovered\n",
    "1. **Latent variables** ($\\mathbf{z}$) are hidden factors that capture the essence of our data\n",
    "2. A regular autoencoder maps each image to a **single point** in latent space\n",
    "3. This creates **dead zones** — empty regions where the decoder produces garbage\n",
    "4. The dead zone problem makes regular autoencoders **poor generators**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "The dead zone problem is not just a minor inconvenience — it is a fundamental limitation. To build a true generative model, we need **every point** in the latent space to produce a valid output. This requires a fundamentally different approach: instead of mapping each image to a single point, we need to map it to a **distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. Why does compressing 784 dimensions to just 2 still preserve the digit identity? What does this tell us about the \"true dimensionality\" of handwritten digits?\n",
    "2. If you increased the latent dimension from 2 to 20, would the dead zone problem get better or worse? (Hint: think about how volume scales with dimension.)\n",
    "3. How is this encoder-decoder setup similar to how your brain processes visual information? When you close your eyes and imagine a \"3\", what is your brain's \"latent code\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Convolutional encoder**: Replace the fully-connected layers with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.ConvTranspose2d`. Does reconstruction improve?\n",
    "2. **Batch normalization**: Add `nn.BatchNorm1d` after each hidden layer. How does it affect training speed and final quality?\n",
    "3. **Deeper network**: Add more hidden layers (e.g., 784 -> 512 -> 256 -> 128 -> 64 -> 2). Does it help?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Next\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Notebook 2: The ELBO and KL Divergence**, we will learn the mathematical framework that transforms our regular autoencoder into a *Variational* Autoencoder:\n",
    "- The **Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)** — the loss function that makes VAEs work\n",
    "- **KL Divergence** — how we measure the \"distance\" between two probability distributions\n",
    "- The **reparameterization trick** — the clever hack that makes it all trainable\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea: instead of mapping each image to a single point, the encoder will output a *probability distribution*, and the KL divergence term will ensure these distributions overlap, filling in the dead zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "See you in Notebook 2!"
