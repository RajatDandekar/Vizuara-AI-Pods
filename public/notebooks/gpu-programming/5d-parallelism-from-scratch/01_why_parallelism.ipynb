    "## 3. The Mathematics of Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us formalize exactly where all this memory goes. When we train a model using **mixed-precision training** with the **Adam optimizer** (which is what virtually all modern LLMs use), each parameter requires memory for four things.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 The Four Memory Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 1: Model Weights (fp16) — 2 bytes per parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model weights are stored in 16-bit floating point (fp16 or bfloat16) during the forward and backward pass. Each fp16 value takes 2 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 2: Gradients (fp16) — 2 bytes per parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "During backpropagation, we compute the gradient of the loss with respect to each parameter. These are also stored in fp16, so 2 bytes per parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component 3: Optimizer States (fp32) — 12 bytes per parameter**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Adam gets expensive. Adam maintains:\n",
    "- A **fp32 copy** of the weights: 4 bytes per parameter\n",
    "- The **first moment** (moving average of gradients): 4 bytes per parameter\n",
    "- The **second moment** (moving average of squared gradients): 4 bytes per parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "That is $4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ bytes per parameter — just for the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Total\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the memory for model state (excluding activations) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{\\text{model}} = P \\times (2 + 2 + 12) = 16P \\text{ bytes}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this equation says: for every single parameter in your model, you need to store the parameter itself (2 bytes), its gradient (2 bytes), and three optimizer buffers (12 bytes). The optimizer alone accounts for **75%** of the model state memory."

    "### 3.2 But Wait — What About Activations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory breakdown above covers the *model state*: weights, gradients, and optimizer states. But there is another major memory consumer: **activations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the forward pass, every layer produces intermediate outputs. These intermediate tensors must be **saved in memory** because the backward pass needs them to compute gradients. This is a fundamental property of backpropagation — you cannot compute gradients without the activations from the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activation memory depends on the model architecture and the training configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{\\text{act}} \\approx 2 \\times B \\times S \\times H \\times L \\times b_{\\text{elem}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $B$ = batch size (number of sequences processed at once)\n",
    "- $S$ = sequence length (number of tokens per sequence)\n",
    "- $H$ = hidden dimension (width of each layer)\n",
    "- $L$ = number of layers (depth of the model)\n",
    "- $b_{\\text{elem}}$ = bytes per element (2 for fp16)\n",
    "- The factor of 2 accounts for both the layer input and the attention intermediate states (a rough approximation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this says: for every token in every sequence in the batch, at every layer, we need to store the hidden representation. The factor of 2 is a simplification — real Transformers store additional intermediates (attention scores, post-LayerNorm values, etc.), but this gives the right order of magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning**: This is a simplified formula. The real activation memory includes attention score matrices (which scale as $B \\times S^2$ per head per layer), post-normalization values, MLP intermediates, and more. For a full treatment, see the Megatron-LM paper. Our formula captures the dominant term for typical configurations."

    "\n",
    "So far we have focused on *memory*. But even if memory were not a problem — imagine GPUs with infinite memory — training would still take an enormous amount of time on a single GPU. This is the **compute bottleneck**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Estimating Training FLOPs\n",
    "\n",
    "A widely used rule of thumb (from the Chinchilla paper and others) estimates the total floating-point operations for training as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{FLOPs}_{\\text{train}} \\approx 6 \\times P \\times D$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P$ = number of model parameters\n",
    "- $D$ = number of training tokens (dataset size)\n",
    "- The factor of 6 comes from: 2 FLOPs per parameter per token for the forward pass (multiply-add), and approximately 2x that for the backward pass, giving $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this says: for each token in the dataset, each parameter participates in a multiply-add during the forward pass, and the backward pass costs roughly twice that. So the total work scales with the product of parameters and tokens."

    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about these questions. They test whether you have truly internalized the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Why do optimizer states dominate the memory budget?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam stores three fp32 buffers per parameter: a copy of the weights, the first moment (mean of gradients), and the second moment (mean of squared gradients). Each is 4 bytes, totaling 12 bytes — compared to just 2 bytes for the fp16 weight itself. This means 75% of model state memory is optimizer state. This insight is the foundation of ZeRO, which we will study in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. If we doubled the sequence length, which memory component grows the most?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Activations. The model state (weights, gradients, optimizer) does not depend on sequence length at all — those are fixed by the number of parameters. But activation memory scales with sequence length (and even quadratically for attention scores). Doubling the sequence length roughly doubles (or more than doubles) activation memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Why can we not just use CPUs with more memory instead of GPUs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "CPUs have far less compute throughput. An A100 GPU delivers ~312 TFLOPS of fp16 compute, while a modern CPU manages maybe 1-5 TFLOPS. Even with unlimited memory, a CPU would take 60-300x longer to train the same model. The parallelism problem is fundamentally about both memory *and* compute — you need fast processors with sufficient total memory, and that means many GPUs."

    "**Challenge 1: Add fp8 Training Support**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `compute_full_memory` function to support fp8 (1 byte per weight/gradient). How much memory does this save? Note that optimizer states remain in fp32.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: MoE Memory Accounting**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Mixture of Experts model like DeepSeek-V3 (671B total params, 37B active per token, 256 experts), only the active parameters contribute to compute FLOPs, but *all* parameters need memory. Modify the planner to separately report \"active\" vs \"total\" parameters and show how this affects the compute vs. memory tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 3: Gradient Checkpointing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient checkpointing (also called activation recomputation) trades compute for memory: instead of storing all activations, we only store activations at \"checkpoint\" layers and recompute the rest during the backward pass. This typically reduces activation memory by $\\sqrt{L}$ (where $L$ is the number of layers) at the cost of ~33% more compute. Add this option to your planner."
