    "Consider a 70B parameter model like Llama 2 70B. Its MLP layers have weight matrices of size **(8192 x 28672)** — that is **235 million parameters** in a single matrix, or **470 MB** in fp16. And there are *two* such matrices per MLP block, plus the attention projections.\n",

    "Now comes the elegant part. The Megatron-LM paper showed that you can wire column-wise and row-wise splits together so that **only one AllReduce** is needed per MLP block.\n",

    "Here is the trick:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First linear layer** ($W_1$): split **column-wise**. Each GPU computes a subset of the intermediate activations.\n",
    "2. **GeLU activation**: applied **locally** on each GPU. No communication needed! Why? Because each GPU has a complete slice of the intermediate features — GeLU is elementwise, so it does not need values from other GPUs.\n",
    "3. **Second linear layer** ($W_2$): split **row-wise**. The input to this layer is already split across GPUs (from step 1), which is exactly what row-wise split expects.\n",
    "4. **AllReduce (sum)**: combine the partial outputs."

    "   GeLU is elementwise — it operates on each value independently. After the column-wise split, each GPU has a complete (though smaller) set of features. Applying GeLU to these local features is exactly the same as applying it to the corresponding entries in the full tensor."

    "3. **Why is TP limited to within a single node in practice?**\n",
    "   TP communicates inside every single layer (2 AllReduces per layer). For a 70B model with 80 layers, that is 160 AllReduces per micro-batch. This communication must be fast enough to not bottleneck the computation. NVLink provides 900 GB/s, while cross-node InfiniBand is ~18x slower at ~50 GB/s.\n",

    "1. **Vary the TP degree**: Modify the code to test TP with `world_size=4` and `world_size=8`. Verify correctness still holds. How does the error change?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **fp16 precision**: Convert the weights and inputs to `torch.float16` and re-run. Does the error increase significantly? This is a real concern in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Asymmetric split**: What if the weight matrix dimensions are not evenly divisible by `world_size`? Implement a version that handles padding or uneven shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute-to-communication ratio**: For a given `hidden_dim` and `seq_len`, calculate the ratio of FLOPs (compute) to bytes transferred (communication). Plot this ratio as `hidden_dim` grows. Why does TP become more efficient for larger models?"
