    "\n",
    "We have now built three of the five dimensions of modern parallelism: **Data Parallelism** (split the batch), **Tensor Parallelism** (split the layers), and **Pipeline Parallelism** (split the depth). These three alone powered most large model training through 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "But two critical challenges remain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1 — Sequences are getting absurdly long.** GPT-3 was trained with 2,048 tokens of context. Claude now handles 200,000. Google Gemini processes over 1,000,000. The memory required for attention scales as $O(n^2)$ — at 128K tokens, a single attention matrix consumes over 60 GB. No single GPU can hold that. We need **Sequence Parallelism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2 — We want massive models but cannot afford to activate all parameters.** DeepSeek-V3 has 671 billion parameters, yet only 37 billion are active for any given token. The trick? A **Mixture of Experts** — hundreds of specialist sub-networks, with a learned router that dispatches each token to just a few relevant experts. We need **Expert Parallelism** to place those experts across GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have:\n",
    "- Built a **Ring Attention** simulation that distributes a long sequence across 4 GPUs in a ring, with K and V blocks rotating until every query has seen every key\n",
    "- Implemented a complete **Mixture-of-Experts layer** with top-K gating, token routing, and load-balancing loss\n",

    "\n",
    "This works beautifully for most of the text. But occasionally a pronoun on page 126 refers back to a character introduced on page 40 — now translator 2 needs information from translator 1. The translators must coordinate at these boundary points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall from Notebook 3 that Tensor Parallelism (TP) splits the weight matrices across GPUs. The attention and MLP computations are split. But what about **LayerNorm** and **Dropout**? In standard TP, these operations are simply **replicated** on every GPU — each GPU computes the identical LayerNorm on the identical input. That is pure waste.\n",

    "Megatron-Style SP fixes this: instead of replicating LayerNorm and Dropout, we **split them along the sequence dimension**. Each GPU handles `seq_len/N` tokens for these operations. The communication pattern changes from AllReduce to ReduceScatter + AllGather, but the total bytes transferred stay the same. We get a memory savings for free.\n",

    "5. Combine the partial attention results using a numerically stable trick\n",

    "The beautiful part: while one GPU is computing attention, the next GPU's K, V is already being transmitted. **Communication overlaps with computation.**\n",

    "\n",
    "For a single head, standard scaled dot-product attention on a full sequence is:\n",

    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Computationally:** We compute an $n \\times n$ score matrix, apply softmax row-wise, then multiply by $V$ to get the output. At $n = 128{,}000$ and $d_k = 128$, the score matrix alone is $128{,}000^2 \\times 4$ bytes $\\approx$ 62 GB in fp32. That does not fit on any single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunked Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we split the sequence into $P$ chunks of size $c = n / P$. GPU $i$ holds:\n",
    "- $Q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times d_k}$ — its query chunk\n",
    "- $K_i, V_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times d_k}$ — its key and value chunks\n",

    "$$O_i = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_i [K_0; K_1; \\ldots; K_{P-1}]^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) [V_0; V_1; \\ldots; V_{P-1}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let us plug in some simple numbers.** With $P = 4$ GPUs and $n = 1024$ tokens, each chunk is $c = 256$ tokens. GPU 0 needs to compute attention of its 256 queries against all 1,024 keys. Instead of materializing the full $256 \\times 1024$ score matrix at once, we compute four blocks of $256 \\times 256$ scores — one per round — and combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Online Softmax Trick\n",

    "**What this says computationally:** We process one block of keys at a time, updating the running maximum, running sum of exponentials, and running weighted sum. The $e^{m_{\\text{old}} - m_{\\text{new}}}$ correction rescales the old statistics when a new maximum is discovered. After all chunks, we divide by the total sum to get the correct softmax-weighted output — identical to computing standard attention on the full sequence."

    "\n",
    "When an order comes in, a **host** (the router) looks at it and decides which chefs should handle it. A ramen order goes to the soup chef (70% contribution) and the appetizer chef for the side dish (30% contribution). A steak dinner might go to the steak chef (80%) and the salad chef (20%). The host does not send every order to every chef — that would be chaotic and wasteful.\n",

    "- **The chefs** are expert sub-networks (typically MLPs)\n",
    "- **The host** is a learned router/gating network\n",
    "- **The orders** are tokens flowing through the Transformer\n",
    "- **The key insight**: only a few experts (top-K) are activated per token\n",

    "## 7. The Mathematics — Mixture of Experts\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Router / Gating Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a token representation $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the router computes gate weights over $N$ experts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = \\text{Softmax}(W_g \\cdot x + b_g)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W_g \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ is the gating weight matrix. This gives us a probability distribution over experts: $g(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ with $\\sum_i g_i(x) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computationally:** We multiply the token's hidden state by a small linear layer and apply softmax. The output tells us how relevant each expert is for this particular token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-K Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "We select only the $K$ experts with the highest gate values and renormalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{TopK}_i(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{g_i(x)}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{top-K}} g_j(x)} & \\text{if } i \\in \\text{top-K indices} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let us plug in some simple numbers.** Suppose we have $N=8$ experts with $K=2$ (top-2 routing). For a given token, the router outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(x) = [0.00, 0.05, 0.60, 0.00, 0.00, 0.35, 0.00, 0.00]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The top-2 experts are Expert 2 ($g_2 = 0.60$) and Expert 5 ($g_5 = 0.35$). After renormalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{g}_2 = \\frac{0.60}{0.60 + 0.35} = 0.632, \\quad \\hat{g}_5 = \\frac{0.35}{0.60 + 0.35} = 0.368$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### MoE Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is the weighted sum of the selected experts' outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{top-K}} \\hat{g}_i(x) \\cdot E_i(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_i(x)$ is the output of expert $i$. For our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = 0.632 \\cdot E_2(x) + 0.368 \\cdot E_5(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computationally:** Only 2 of the 8 expert MLPs actually run a forward pass. The other 6 are skipped entirely. This is where the computational savings come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Balancing Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Without encouragement, the router will often collapse — sending most tokens to just one or two experts while the rest sit idle. This is disastrous for Expert Parallelism because it means some GPUs are overloaded while others are idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The auxiliary load balancing loss encourages even distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}} = \\alpha \\cdot N \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f_i \\cdot P_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $f_i = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\mathbb{1}[\\text{token } t \\text{ is routed to expert } i]$ — the fraction of tokens assigned to expert $i$\n",
    "- $P_i = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} g_i(x_t)$ — the average gate probability for expert $i$\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is a small coefficient (typically 0.01)\n",
    "- $N$ is the number of experts (scaling factor)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this says computationally:** If expert $i$ gets a disproportionate fraction of tokens ($f_i$ is high) AND the router gives it high probability ($P_i$ is high), the loss increases. The $N$ multiplier ensures the loss scale is independent of the number of experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical example:** With $N=4$ experts, $T=8$ tokens, $\\alpha = 0.01$:\n",
    "\n",
    "If tokens are perfectly balanced: $f_i = 0.25$ for all $i$, and $P_i \\approx 0.25$:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}} = 0.01 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times (0.25 \\times 0.25) = 0.01$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If tokens all go to Expert 0: $f_0 = 1.0, P_0 \\approx 1.0$, others zero:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{aux}} = 0.01 \\times 4 \\times (1.0 \\times 1.0) = 0.04$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The collapsed case has 4x higher loss, pushing the router toward balance."

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why does Ring Attention need the online softmax trick?** Consider what would happen if each GPU computed `softmax(Q_local @ K_block.T / sqrt(d_k)) @ V_block` independently and then summed the results. Would the answer be correct? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-1 vs Top-2 vs Top-8 routing:** With top-1, each token sees only one expert — faster but less expressive. With top-8 (like DeepSeek-V3), each token blends 8 expert opinions — more expressive but 8x more compute. What is the trade-off? Why did DeepSeek choose top-8?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load balancing failure modes:** Without the auxiliary loss, the router often collapses to using 1-2 experts. Why does this happen from an optimization perspective? (Hint: think about gradient flow — if an expert is never selected, does it ever get gradients?)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining SP and EP:** In a real system, a single Transformer layer might use Tensor Parallelism for attention, Sequence Parallelism for LayerNorm, and Expert Parallelism for the MoE-MLP. How do the communication patterns interact?"

    "1. **Causal Ring Attention:** Our implementation computes full (bidirectional) attention. Modify it to support causal masking, where tokens can only attend to earlier positions. What blocks in the attention matrix become zero?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expert Capacity Factor:** In practice, each expert has a maximum number of tokens it can process (the \"capacity\"). Implement a capacity factor of 1.25 — each expert can handle at most $1.25 \\times T/N$ tokens. Tokens that exceed capacity are dropped. How does this interact with load balancing?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Shared Expert (DeepSeek-V3):** DeepSeek-V3 uses one \"shared\" expert that processes ALL tokens, plus top-K from the remaining routed experts. Implement this: `y = E_shared(x) + sum(g_i * E_i(x))`. Why might this help?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flash Attention integration:** Our ring attention recomputes the full $c \\times c$ attention block. In practice, each block would use Flash Attention (tiled, memory-efficient). Research how Flash Attention tiles the computation and sketch how it would integrate into the ring."
