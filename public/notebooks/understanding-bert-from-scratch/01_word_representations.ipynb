    "Computationally, this says: take the dot product between the context word's output vector $\\mathbf{u}_{w_o}$ and the center word's input vector $\\mathbf{v}_{w_c}$, then normalize over the entire vocabulary using softmax. A higher dot product means the model thinks these words are more likely to appear together.\n",

    "## 9. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. Why can't we just increase Word2Vec's embedding dimension to solve the polysemy problem? (Hint: think about what the model is optimizing for.)\n",
    "2. If ELMo concatenates forward and backward LSTMs, why is that considered \"shallow\" bidirectionality? What would \"deep\" bidirectionality look like?\n",
    "3. Word2Vec was trained on billions of words but still has the polysemy problem. Does more data help, or is it a fundamental architectural limitation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Negative Sampling**: Our Word2Vec uses full softmax, which is slow for large vocabularies. Implement negative sampling — instead of normalizing over all words, randomly sample 5-10 \"negative\" context words and train a binary classifier.\n",
    "2. **CBOW Model**: Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) variant, which predicts the center word from the context words (the reverse of Skip-gram).\n",
    "3. **Larger Corpus**: Download a real text corpus (e.g., WikiText-2) and train Word2Vec on it. Do the embeddings capture more meaningful relationships?"
