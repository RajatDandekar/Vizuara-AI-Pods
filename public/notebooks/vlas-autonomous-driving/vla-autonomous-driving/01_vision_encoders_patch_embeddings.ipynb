    "## 1. Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a simple question: how does a self-driving car *see*?\n",
    "\n",
    "A human driver glances at the road ahead, checks the mirrors, notices a pedestrian stepping off the curb, spots a red brake light two cars ahead — all in a fraction of a second. We process rich visual information effortlessly. But for an autonomous vehicle, the raw camera feed is just a grid of numbers — millions of pixel values streaming in from 4 to 8 cameras with 360-degree coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs)** are a new class of models that take these camera images, convert them into compact \"feature tokens\" (just like words in a sentence), feed them to a language model, and output driving actions — steering, acceleration, braking. The first and arguably most critical step in this entire pipeline is the **Vision Encoder**: the component that converts raw pixels into meaningful representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dominant approach? The **Vision Transformer (ViT)**. It splits each camera image into a grid of small patches, treats each patch as a \"word,\" and uses self-attention to understand how the patches relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Build a complete Vision Transformer from scratch in PyTorch\n",
    "- Train it on real images and achieve reasonable accuracy\n",
    "- Visualize **attention heatmaps** showing exactly which parts of the image the model focuses on\n",
    "- Understand every mathematical operation happening inside\n",

    "\n",
    "**Analogy 1: Reading a newspaper page.** Imagine you pick up a newspaper. You do not read every single letter from top-left to bottom-right. Your eyes jump to headlines, photographs, bold text, and key paragraphs. You quickly understand the \"layout\" — where the important stuff is. A Vision Transformer does something remarkably similar with images. It divides the image into patches and learns which patches matter and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy 2: Tiles in a mosaic.** Think of a large mosaic on a wall. Each small tile contains a tiny piece of the picture — maybe a sliver of blue sky, or a fragment of a face. Individually, each tile tells you very little. But your brain naturally groups tiles together: \"these blue tiles are sky,\" \"these tan tiles form a face,\" \"these red tiles are a flower.\" The transformer's self-attention mechanism does the same thing — it figures out which tiles (patches) are related. In driving, this means: \"this patch has a red light AND this patch shows a car bumper ahead, so there is a car braking in front of us.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "Why patches instead of individual pixels? This comes down to computational cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Pixel-level attention:** 184,320^2 = ~34 billion operations. Not feasible.\n",
    "- **With 16x16 patches:** we get (320/16) x (576/16) = 20 x 36 = 720 patches. And 720^2 = 518,400 operations. Entirely manageable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let us look at the three key mathematical operations inside a Vision Transformer. We will take each one, explain what it does computationally, and work through a concrete numerical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Patch Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}_i = \\mathbf{W}_p \\cdot \\text{flatten}(\\text{patch}_i) + \\mathbf{b}_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this say? Take each 16 x 16 x 3 patch (that is 16 x 16 pixels across 3 color channels = 768 values), flatten it into a single vector, and multiply by a learned weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}_p$ to project it into a $d$-dimensional embedding space. Then add a bias term. This is literally a linear projection — a matrix multiplication followed by an addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let us plug in some simple numbers.** Suppose we have a tiny 4 x 4 x 1 patch (grayscale, so 1 channel). Flattened, this gives us a vector of 16 values. Say our embedding dimension is $d = 3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{patch} = [0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.8, \\ldots] \\quad (\\text{16 values})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{W}_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 16}, \\quad \\mathbf{b}_p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}_i = \\mathbf{W}_p \\cdot \\text{patch} + \\mathbf{b}_p = [1.3, -0.7, 0.4]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So a 16-dimensional raw patch gets compressed into a 3-dimensional embedding vector. In practice, the embedding dimension is much larger (e.g., 128 or 768), but the operation is exactly the same — a matrix multiply.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}_i' = \\mathbf{z}_i + \\mathbf{e}_i^{\\text{pos}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After embedding each patch, we add a **learnable position vector** so the model knows *where* each patch came from in the original image. Without positional encoding, the model would see a bag of patches with no spatial information — it could not distinguish \"car in the top-left\" from \"car in the bottom-right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worked example.** Suppose patch 0 (top-left corner) has embedding $\\mathbf{z}_0 = [1.3, -0.7, 0.4]$ and its learnable position vector is $\\mathbf{e}_0^{\\text{pos}} = [0.1, 0.2, -0.1]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}_0' = [1.3 + 0.1, \\; -0.7 + 0.2, \\; 0.4 + (-0.1)] = [1.4, -0.5, 0.3]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Patch 5 (somewhere in the middle) would have a different position vector $\\mathbf{e}_5^{\\text{pos}} = [-0.3, 0.5, 0.6]$, so even if two patches had identical pixel content, their final representations would differ based on where they sit in the image. This is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the heart of the transformer. Let us break it down computationally:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q (Query):** Each patch asks \"what am I looking for?\"\n",
    "- **K (Key):** Each patch declares \"what do I contain?\"\n",
    "- **$QK^T$ (dot product):** Measures compatibility between every pair of patches. High score means \"these two patches are relevant to each other.\"\n",
    "- **$\\sqrt{d_k}$ (scaling):** Prevents the dot products from growing too large, which would push softmax into regions where gradients vanish.\n",
    "- **Softmax:** Converts raw scores into attention weights that sum to 1 — a probability distribution over patches.\n",
    "- **Multiply by V (Value):** Produces a weighted combination of all patches, emphasizing the most relevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worked example with 3 patches, $d_k = 2$.** Suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad K = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad V = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.8 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.9 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 — Compute $QK^T$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$QK^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 — Scale by $\\sqrt{d_k} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.71 & 0 & 0.71 \\\\ 0.71 & 0.71 & 0 \\\\ 1.41 & 0.71 & 0.71 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 — Apply softmax to each row (we get attention weights):\n",
    "\n",
    "Row 1: $[0.40, 0.20, 0.40]$ — Patch 1 attends equally to patches 1 and 3, less to patch 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 — Multiply by V: the output for patch 1 would be $0.40 \\times [0.5, 0.3] + 0.20 \\times [0.8, 0.1] + 0.40 \\times [0.2, 0.9] = [0.44, 0.50]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that patch 1's new representation is a weighted blend of all patches, with more weight on patches 1 and 3. In a driving scene, this is how the model learns that a brake light patch and a bumper patch should attend to each other."

    "## 9. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patch size tradeoff:** We used 4x4 patches on 32x32 images (64 patches). What would change if we used 2x2 patches (256 patches)? We would get finer spatial resolution — each patch captures more localized details. But the attention computation grows quadratically: 256^2 = 65,536 vs. 64^2 = 4,096. That is a 16x increase in attention cost. There is a fundamental tradeoff between resolution and computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why CLS token?** Why use a special CLS token instead of, say, averaging all patch embeddings? In the first transformer layer, before the model has learned anything useful, averaging random patch representations would give a noisy mess. The CLS token starts as a learnable \"query\" that progressively accumulates information from all patches through attention. It acts as a dedicated summarization slot. That said, some recent ViT variants do use global average pooling instead of CLS, and they work well too.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Driving scene attention patterns:** Would you expect the attention pattern for a highway scene to look different from a city intersection? Absolutely. On a highway, the model would likely attend strongly to the lane markings, the car directly ahead, and the road curvature. At a city intersection, attention would be much more distributed — pedestrians, traffic lights, crossing vehicles, turn lanes. This is the beauty of self-attention: it adapts dynamically to the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Larger patches:** Change `patch_size` to 8 (giving only 16 patches) and retrain. How does accuracy change? What do the attention maps look like with so few patches?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **More heads:** Try 8 heads instead of 4. Visualize each head's attention pattern separately — do different heads learn to focus on different visual features?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-camera fusion:** This is closer to real driving VLAs. Modify the model to process 4 images simultaneously (simulating front, left, right, and rear cameras). Concatenate their patch tokens into a single sequence before the transformer layers. Does the attention mechanism learn cross-camera relationships?"
