But a car needs continuous signals: steer 15.3 degrees left, accelerate at 2.1 m/s squared, follow a smooth curve through the intersection. How do we bridge this gap? How do we get a model that \"speaks\" in English to also \"speak\" in steering angles?\n",

    "## Section 1 — Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the core tension. Systems like RT-2 from Google DeepMind and EMMA from Waymo are built on large language models — models with a fixed vocabulary of text tokens. These models are extraordinarily good at understanding images, following instructions, and reasoning about situations. But they were never designed to output continuous numbers like \"steer 14.7 degrees.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So researchers asked: **what if we just made steering angles part of the vocabulary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is action tokenization. Instead of outputting the continuous value 15.0 degrees, the model outputs **token 170** — a discrete symbol that represents the bin containing 15.0 degrees. The car's controller then converts token 170 back to approximately 15.0 degrees and turns the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is powerful because it lets us use the **exact same training recipe** as language modeling. The model predicts the next token in a sequence — sometimes that token is a word describing the scene, and sometimes it is an action token telling the car what to do. Same architecture, same loss function, same training loop. This is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the question remains: does discretizing continuous actions lose too much precision? And how do we actually train a model to imitate expert drivers? Let us find out."

    "### The Sheet Music Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are listening to a guitar solo — a continuous, flowing melody with subtle bends, vibrato, and slides between notes. Now imagine writing that solo as sheet music. Sheet music uses discrete symbols: quarter notes, half notes, specific pitches on a staff. You lose some of the continuous nuance — the exact micro-bend between two frets, the precise vibrato speed. But if your notation system is detailed enough (32nd notes, bend markers, dynamics), you can recreate the solo with remarkable fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Action tokenization does the same thing for driving. The continuous \"melody\" of steering is written as discrete \"notes\" — bin indices — that a language model can read and produce. With enough bins (256 is typical), the notation is precise enough that the reconstruction error is imperceptible to the car's physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Thermometer Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a thermometer. The actual temperature outside is continuous — it might be exactly 72.347 degrees Fahrenheit. But your weather app shows \"72 degrees.\" It rounds to the nearest integer. With 256 bins spanning a 90-degree steering range, we are rounding to the nearest 0.35 degrees. That is less than the mechanical play in most steering systems. The car cannot even tell the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Fits Into the VLA Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Vision-Language-Action model for driving:\n",
    "1. A camera image goes in.\n",
    "2. A language description of the driving task goes in (e.g., \"follow the road, turn left at the intersection\").\n",
    "3. The model outputs a sequence of action tokens — one per timestep.\n",
    "4. Each action token is detokenized back to a continuous steering angle.\n",
    "5. The car executes the steering command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data consists of triplets: (camera image, language description, expert action). We train the model to predict the expert's action token given the image and language — this is **behavioral cloning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use 256 bins for a steering range of [-45 degrees, 45 degrees], what is the maximum tokenization error? The total range is 90 degrees, divided into 255 intervals (256 bins means 255 gaps between them). That gives us 90 / 255 = 0.353 degrees per bin. The maximum error from rounding is half a bin width: **0.176 degrees**. That is remarkably precise — far below what a human driver can consistently achieve."

    "\n",
    "Let us now formalize these ideas. We will work through three equations, and for each one, we will plug in concrete numbers so you can trace through the computation yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation 1: Action Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a continuous action $a$ (say, a steering angle), we convert it to a discrete token index:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{\\text{token}} = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{a - a_{\\min}}{a_{\\max} - a_{\\min}} \\times (N_{\\text{bins}} - 1)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us break this down computationally, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subtract $a_{\\min}$**: shifts the range so it starts at zero.\n",
    "2. **Divide by $(a_{\\max} - a_{\\min})$**: normalizes to $[0, 1]$.\n",
    "3. **Multiply by $(N_{\\text{bins}} - 1)$**: scales to $[0, N_{\\text{bins}} - 1]$.\n",
    "4. **Round**: snaps to the nearest integer. That integer IS the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worked example:** A steering angle of 15 degrees, with range $[-45, 45]$ and 256 bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{\\text{token}} = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{15 - (-45)}{45 - (-45)} \\times (256 - 1)\\right) = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{60}{90} \\times 255\\right) = \\text{round}(170.0) = 170$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So steering 15 degrees to the right maps to **token 170**. This is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation 2: Detokenization (The Inverse)\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a token back to a continuous action:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\frac{a_{\\text{token}}}{N_{\\text{bins}} - 1} \\times (a_{\\max} - a_{\\min}) + a_{\\min}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worked example:** Token 170 back to a steering angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\frac{170}{255} \\times (45 - (-45)) + (-45) = 0.6667 \\times 90 + (-45) = 60.0 - 45.0 = 15.0°$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect roundtrip. Token 170 reconstructs exactly to 15.0 degrees. Not all values will reconstruct perfectly — values that fall between bin centers will have a small rounding error — but with 256 bins, the maximum error is only 0.176 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation 3: Behavioral Cloning Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we train a model to imitate expert drivers? At each timestep $t$, the model sees an image $I_t$ and language instruction $\\ell$, and predicts a probability distribution over all $N_{\\text{bins}}$ action tokens. The behavioral cloning loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = -\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log p_\\theta(a_t \\mid I_t, \\ell)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is cross-entropy loss. For each timestep, the model outputs a distribution over 256 bins. The loss measures how much probability mass the model places on the **correct** token — the one the expert chose. If the model assigns probability 1.0 to the correct token, $\\log(1.0) = 0$, and the loss is zero. If it assigns probability 0.01, $\\log(0.01) = -4.6$, and the loss is large. The model learns to concentrate its predictions on the expert's choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worked example:** Suppose $T = 3$ timesteps, and the model assigns these probabilities to the expert's chosen tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Timestep | Expert Token | Model's Probability | $-\\log p$ |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|\n",
    "| $t=1$ | 170 | 0.8 | 0.223 |\n",
    "| $t=2$ | 128 | 0.5 | 0.693 |\n",
    "| $t=3$ | 200 | 0.9 | 0.105 |\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L} = 0.223 + 0.693 + 0.105 = 1.021$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the model improved and assigned probability 0.95 to all three expert tokens, the loss would drop to $3 \\times 0.051 = 0.154$. Lower loss means the model is more confident about the expert's actions. This is exactly what we want."

    "## Section 7 — Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented two fundamental building blocks used in state-of-the-art VLA driving systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Action Tokenization** — converting continuous steering angles into discrete tokens that a language model can predict. We showed that with 256 bins, the quantization error is negligible (less than 0.18 degrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Behavioral Cloning** — training a model to imitate expert drivers by minimizing cross-entropy loss over action tokens. The model learns to assign high probability to the expert's chosen actions, exactly like a language model learns to predict the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bin count tradeoffs:** We used 256 bins. What would happen with only 8 bins? The max error would jump to ~6.4 degrees — large enough to cause noticeable weaving. With 4096 bins? The error drops to 0.011 degrees, but the model must predict over a much larger vocabulary, which can slow convergence. 256 is the sweet spot for most driving applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expert quality matters:** Behavioral cloning faithfully imitates whatever the expert does — including mistakes. If the expert occasionally swerves unnecessarily, the model learns that too. This is both a strength (simple, stable training) and a weakness (garbage in, garbage out). Systems like DAgger address this by iteratively collecting corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why cross-entropy and not MSE?** Cross-entropy treats action prediction as classification over bins, which handles multimodal distributions naturally. If there are two valid steering angles at a junction (slight left or slight right), cross-entropy can assign probability mass to both. MSE would average them, predicting \"go straight\" — which might be the worst option. This is a critical advantage for real-world driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-dimensional tokenization:** Extend the tokenizer to handle both steering AND acceleration simultaneously. With 256 bins each, you need $256 \\times 256 = 65{,}536$ joint tokens — or you can tokenize each dimension independently (just 512 tokens total). Which approach do RT-2 and EMMA use, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autoregressive prediction:** Replace the parallel action heads with an LSTM or Transformer that predicts one action token at a time, conditioned on all previous predictions. This is closer to how real VLAs work. Does it improve trajectory smoothness?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Covariate shift experiment:** After training, roll out the model in the environment: at each step, use the model's *own predicted* position (not the expert's) to compute the next action. Watch what happens as small errors accumulate. This is the **covariate shift** problem — the model encounters states it never saw during training because it was always shown the expert's states. How quickly do trajectories diverge?"
