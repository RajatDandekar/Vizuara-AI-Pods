    "Let us start with the big picture. In the previous notebooks, we built two separate components: a vision encoder that converts camera images into compact feature tokens, and an action tokenizer that converts continuous steering angles into discrete tokens. Both are powerful on their own, but neither can drive a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because driving requires all three capabilities **simultaneously**: the model must **see** the road (vision), **understand** what is happening and what to do (language), and **act** on that understanding by outputting a trajectory (action). A vision encoder alone sees objects but cannot reason about them. An action tokenizer alone produces outputs but has no idea what is happening on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could build **one single model** that takes in a camera image, reads a text command like \"go to the red circle,\" and directly outputs a driving trajectory? This is precisely what a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model does. This is the same principle behind RT-2 (Google DeepMind), EMMA (Waymo), and NVIDIA's Alpamayo -- the most advanced driving models in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have built a complete mini VLA from scratch. You will feed it an image and a text command, and it will output a trajectory. Let us get started."

    "Think of a multilingual translator who can also cook. They can read a recipe in French (text), look at photos of the ingredients (vision), and then actually prepare the dish (action). They do not need three separate brains for reading, seeing, and cooking -- it all happens in one integrated mind where each capability informs the others. If the recipe says \"sear until golden brown,\" they **look** at the pan to judge the color, **understand** what \"golden brown\" means from the text, and **act** by flipping the food at the right moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VLA model works exactly the same way. It \"reads\" the road scene through its vision encoder, \"understands\" the driving instruction through its language backbone, and \"cooks up\" a trajectory through its action decoder. All in one unified architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is the key insight from RT-2 that makes this unification so elegant. If we put action tokens into the same vocabulary as words, then generating an action is **literally the same computation** as generating the next word in a sentence. The model does not know the difference between outputting the word \"turn\" and outputting the action token for \"turn the wheel 15 degrees.\" To the transformer, both are just the next token to predict. This is why driving IS language -- the same attention mechanism, the same softmax, the same autoregressive generation loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it valuable to have **one model** that handles vision, language, AND action? Why not three separate specialists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared representations.** When the model sees a red traffic light, the visual feature for \"red light\" can directly inform both the language understanding (\"the traffic light is red, I should stop\") and the action output (\"apply brakes, decelerate to zero\"). With separate specialists, you would need to explicitly pass messages between them -- and any miscommunication means errors cascade.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emergent capabilities.** A unified model can generalize to novel commands it has never seen during training. If you tell RT-2 to \"pick up the object closest to the blue ball\" -- an instruction it was never trained on -- it can do it. The vision-language grounding and action generation work together to handle novel combinations. Three separate specialists could never achieve this."

    "## 3. The Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write any code, let us understand the two key mathematical operations that make a VLA tick.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Cross-Attention: How Vision and Language Talk to Each Other\n",
    "\n",
    "The core fusion mechanism in a VLA is **cross-attention**. The idea is simple: the text tokens \"ask questions\" about the image, and the visual tokens provide the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CrossAttn}(Q_{\\text{text}}, K_{\\text{vis}}, V_{\\text{vis}}) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_{\\text{text}} K_{\\text{vis}}^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V_{\\text{vis}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Q_{\\text{text}}$ are the **query** vectors from the text encoder. Think of each query as a question: \"Is there a red light in the scene?\"\n",
    "- $K_{\\text{vis}}$ are the **key** vectors from the vision encoder. Each key represents what a particular image patch contains.\n",
    "- $V_{\\text{vis}}$ are the **value** vectors from the vision encoder. These carry the actual visual information to transfer.\n",
    "- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors. We divide by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ to keep the numbers from getting too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us plug in some simple numbers to see how this works. Suppose we have 2 text tokens and 3 visual tokens, each with dimension $d_k = 4$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_{\\text{text}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad K_{\\text{vis}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Compute $Q K^T$ (each text token scores against each visual token):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q K^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot 0 & \\cdots \\\\ \\cdots & \\cdots \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Scale by $\\sqrt{d_k} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.5 & 1.0 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.0 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Apply softmax across visual tokens (each row sums to 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{weights} \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} 0.26 & 0.26 & 0.43 \\\\ 0.36 & 0.36 & 0.22 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that text token 1 attends most strongly to visual token 3 (weight 0.43), while text token 2 attends equally to visual tokens 1 and 2. The text is \"looking\" at the parts of the image most relevant to its query. This is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Autoregressive Action Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The second key idea is how the model generates actions. Just like GPT generates one word at a time, a VLA generates one action token at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(a_{1:T} \\mid I, \\ell) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} p_\\theta(a_t \\mid a_{<t}, I, \\ell)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $I$ is the image, $\\ell$ is the language command, and $a_{1:T}$ is the sequence of action tokens (e.g., trajectory waypoints). Each action $a_t$ is conditioned on the image, the text, AND all previous actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us plug in numbers. Suppose we generate $T = 3$ waypoint tokens, and at each step the model assigns probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p(a_1 \\mid I, \\ell) = 0.7$ -- first waypoint, fairly confident\n",
    "- $p(a_2 \\mid a_1, I, \\ell) = 0.9$ -- second waypoint, very confident given the first\n",
    "- $p(a_3 \\mid a_1, a_2, I, \\ell) = 0.6$ -- third waypoint, less certain\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the full trajectory:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(a_{1:3} \\mid I, \\ell) = 0.7 \\times 0.9 \\times 0.6 = 0.378$$\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, we maximize this probability for expert trajectories. A model that assigns higher probability to expert actions will produce better driving trajectories at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our mini VLA, we will simplify this by predicting all waypoints at once (regression instead of autoregressive). But the principle remains: image + text goes in, trajectory comes out."

    "## 8. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a step back and appreciate what we have accomplished. We built a complete Vision-Language-Action model from scratch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vision Encoder** -- converts raw images into 64 spatial feature tokens\n",
    "2. **Text Encoder** -- converts word sequences into contextual embeddings\n",
    "3. **Cross-Attention** -- fuses vision and language so text can \"look at\" the image\n",
    "4. **Action Decoder** -- maps fused features to trajectory waypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the exact same architecture used by RT-2, EMMA, and Alpamayo -- the only difference is scale. Our model has ~100K parameters; Alpamayo has 10.5 billion. But the data flow is identical: image + text in, trajectory out, with cross-attention as the fusion mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-attention vs concatenation.** Our model uses cross-attention to fuse vision and language. What would happen if we simply concatenated the visual and text tokens into one long sequence and applied self-attention? When would cross-attention be strictly better? (Hint: think about what happens when the text is very short but the image has many tokens.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression vs tokenization.** We predicted waypoints directly using MSE regression. How would the architecture change if we used action tokenization (from Notebook 2) instead? What are the tradeoffs? (Hint: tokenization allows the model to express **uncertainty** -- it can assign probability mass to multiple possible actions. Regression predicts only one.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emergent generalization.** RT-2 can follow commands like \"pick up the object closest to the blue ball\" even though it was never trained on that phrase. What property of large pre-trained VLMs enables this? Could our tiny model do the same? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add \"avoid\" commands.** Modify `generate_command_and_target` to create \"avoid red circle\" commands where the trajectory should curve **away** from the named object. Train the model on mixed \"go to\" and \"avoid\" data. Does it learn both behaviors?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Autoregressive generation.** Instead of predicting all 10 waypoints at once, modify the action decoder to predict them one at a time, each conditioned on the previous waypoints. This is closer to how RT-2 and EMMA actually generate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-step reasoning.** Create scenes with 5+ objects and commands like \"go to the red circle near the blue square.\" This requires the model to understand spatial relationships -- a significant step up in complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Diffusion decoder.** Replace the MLP action decoder with a simple diffusion decoder that starts from Gaussian noise and iteratively refines it into a trajectory. This is what Alpamayo uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have now built a complete Vision-Language-Action model from scratch. This is the same principle behind every major driving VLA -- one model that sees, understands, and acts. The rest is scale."
