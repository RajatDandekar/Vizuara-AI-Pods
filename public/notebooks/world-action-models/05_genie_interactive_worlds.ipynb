    "The tokenizer converts a continuous image into a discrete representation using **Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)**.\n",

    "**What this means computationally:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The encoder (a CNN) takes the raw frame $x_i$ and produces a continuous feature map $z_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times w \\times D}$, where $h, w$ are the spatial dimensions after downsampling and $D$ is the embedding dimension.\n",
    "2. We maintain a **codebook** $\\mathcal{C} = \\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_K\\}$ of $K$ learnable vectors, each of dimension $D$.\n",
    "3. For each spatial position in $z_i$, we find the **nearest codebook vector**: $t_{i,j} = \\arg\\min_k \\|z_{i,j} - e_k\\|_2$.\n",

If the training data contains platformer games, the model might discover actions that correspond to \"left,\" \"right,\" \"jump,\" and \"idle\" — but these labels are never provided.\n",

    "## 9. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why discrete actions?** Our Latent Action Model outputs a *discrete* categorical distribution over actions, not a continuous vector. Why is discreteness important for interactive control? What would happen if we used a continuous latent action space instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Codebook size matters.** We used a codebook of 64 entries for the video tokenizer. What would happen if we used only 4 entries? What about 1024? How does codebook size relate to the reconstruction quality vs. compactness tradeoff?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scaling to real images.** Our sprites are 16x16 pixels. Genie 1 works on 256x256 platformer games. Genie 2 generates minute-long videos. What architectural changes would be needed to scale this approach to realistic images? (Hint: think about the tokenizer, the dynamics model architecture, and training data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1: Better Dynamics Model.** Replace the CNN dynamics model with a small Transformer. Instead of operating on the 2D spatial grid with convolutions, flatten the token grid into a sequence, prepend the action token, and use self-attention to predict next-frame tokens. Does this improve prediction quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: Conditional Starting Frames.** Instead of using a frame from the dataset, try creating a hand-drawn starting frame (e.g., draw a white square at a specific position). Feed it to the model and generate an interactive trajectory. Does the model generalize to starting frames it has never seen during training? This is exactly what Genie does — it takes a *sketch* and makes it playable."
