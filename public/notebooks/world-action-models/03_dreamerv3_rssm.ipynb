    "\n",

    "The real world has **both predictable parts and random parts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us think about this with an analogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weather forecasting.** Some aspects of weather are highly predictable: the sun will rise tomorrow, summer will be warmer than winter, and high pressure systems move in predictable patterns. A deterministic model captures these regularities beautifully.\n",
    "\n",
    "But other aspects are genuinely random: will it rain at 3:47 PM on Tuesday? Will a sudden gust of wind knock over your umbrella? These stochastic elements cannot be captured by a purely deterministic model — no matter how large we make it.\n",

    "\n",
    "It maintains two parallel streams of information:\n",
    "1. A **deterministic path** (like a GRU) that captures the predictable, consistent dynamics\n",

We concatenate $z_{t-1}$ and $a_{t-1}$ to get $[0.1, 0.3, 1.0]$ and feed this as input to the GRU with hidden state $[0.5, -0.2, 0.8]$. The GRU applies its learned gates and produces a new hidden state, say $h_t = [0.7, 0.1, -0.3]$. This new state captures the predictable evolution of the world."

    "## 9. Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to reflect on what we have built. The key insight is profound: once you have a good world model, you can train a policy **without any real environment interaction.** This is what makes DreamerV3 so sample-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why does the RSSM use both a deterministic and stochastic path?** Could we achieve the same result with just one of them? What would we lose?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The KL divergence loss pushes the prior toward the posterior.** What would happen if we removed this loss entirely? How would imagination quality be affected?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DreamerV3 uses discrete categorical latents (32 variables x 32 classes) instead of continuous Gaussians.** Why might discrete latents be better for modeling complex environments? (Hint: think about multimodal distributions — the ball could go left OR right.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1: Discrete Latents.** Replace the Gaussian stochastic path with categorical distributions. Use `torch.distributions.OneHotCategorical` with straight-through gradients. Compare the KL divergence behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: Symlog Predictions.** DreamerV3 uses a \"symlog\" transformation for predictions: $\\text{symlog}(x) = \\text{sign}(x) \\ln(|x| + 1)$. Implement this for the reward predictor and see if it stabilizes training on environments with varying reward scales."

    "### What Comes Next\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we built the RSSM — the world model that powers DreamerV3's imagination. But DreamerV3 is just one approach to learning about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will explore a fundamentally different philosophy: **what if we do not need to predict pixels at all?** Yann LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) argues that predicting in abstract representation space is both more efficient and more aligned with how biological brains work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is: can we build a world model that understands without reconstructing?\n",

    "We will find out in **Notebook 4: JEPA — Predicting in Abstract Space.**\n",
