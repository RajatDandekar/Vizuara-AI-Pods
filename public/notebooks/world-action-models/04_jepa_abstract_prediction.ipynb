    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Pixel Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative models like VAEs and diffusion models learn by reconstructing pixels. They must predict every single pixel value — the exact shade of grass, the precise pattern of shadows, the specific texture of a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what that means: a model that is trying to understand \"there is a dog in this image\" must also spend capacity learning \"the third blade of grass is 2 pixels wide and has RGB value (34, 120, 45).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is enormously wasteful. The model wastes representational power on **surface-level details** that carry little semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JEPA's Core Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "JEPA says: **predict in abstract space, not pixel space.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of forcing the model to reconstruct the raw image, we:\n",
    "1. Encode the image into a compact representation (an embedding)\n",
    "2. Predict **embeddings** of missing parts from the embeddings of visible parts\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference: embeddings naturally discard irrelevant details and preserve semantic meaning.\n",

    "1. Take an image and split it into **patches** (like a grid of small squares)\n",

    "6. The loss is simply: how close are the predicted embeddings to the actual target embeddings?\n",

Then the predictor's job is trivially easy — just predict zeros. The loss would be zero, but the representations would be completely useless. This is called **representation collapse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMA update prevents this by making the target encoder a **slowly evolving** version of the context encoder. Since the target does not receive gradients, it cannot collapse to a trivial solution. And since it tracks the context encoder slowly, it provides a stable, meaningful target.\n",

    "**Challenge 1: V-JEPA Extension**\n",
    "The temporal extension of JEPA (V-JEPA) predicts video frame embeddings from past frame embeddings. How would you modify our architecture to handle video? Sketch out the changes needed:\n",
    "- How would patch embedding change for 3D data (spatial + temporal)?\n",
    "- What would the masking strategy look like across frames?\n",
    "- How would the predictor condition on both spatial and temporal context?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: Improve Linear Probe Accuracy**\n",
    "Try to push the linear probe accuracy higher by experimenting with:\n",
    "- Increasing `embed_dim` from 128 to 256\n",
    "- Training for more epochs (30-50)\n",
    "- Using a different masking ratio (try 0.6 or 0.75)\n",
    "- Adding data augmentation (random crops, color jitter)\n",
    "- Using a deeper encoder (6-8 layers instead of 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Track how each change affects the final accuracy and training time."

    "In the next notebook, we will explore how these learned representations can be connected to **actions** — bridging the gap from perception to decision-making. We will see how models like **VLAs (Vision-Language-Action models)** combine visual understanding with language instructions to produce robot actions.\n",
