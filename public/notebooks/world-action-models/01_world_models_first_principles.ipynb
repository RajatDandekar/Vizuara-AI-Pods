    "Before we write any code or equations, let us build a mental model for what a world model actually does. We will compare two fundamentally different approaches to learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-Free Learning: Learning by Crashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are learning to drive a car, but the *only* way you are allowed to learn is by getting into a real car on a real road:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You press the gas. The car lurches forward. You crash into a wall. **Negative reward.**\n",
    "- You try again. This time you turn the wheel slightly. You swerve off the road. **Negative reward.**\n",
    "- After 50,000 crashes, you start to develop reflexes. Gas pedal here, brake there, turn the wheel this much at that speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned a **policy** — a mapping from situations to actions — but you have learned it entirely through pain. You never understood *why* pressing the gas makes the car accelerate. You just learned the pattern: \"when I see this, do that.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **model-free reinforcement learning.** It works, but it is brutally inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-Based Learning: The Driving Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine a different approach. Before you ever touch a real car, someone gives you a **driving simulator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can try any action and instantly see what *would* happen.\n",
    "- You can rewind and try a different action.\n",
    "- You can simulate 1,000 scenarios in the time it takes to drive one mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the simulator, you learn the **physics** of driving — how steering angle affects trajectory, how speed affects braking distance. You build an internal model of how the world works, and then you use that model to plan your actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **model-based reinforcement learning.** The simulator is your world model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Think About This\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, consider this thought experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A model-free agent needs to interact with the real environment for every single learning step. Each interaction costs time, energy, and potentially real-world consequences.\n",
    "- A model-based agent can \"imagine\" thousands of interactions inside its head. The only real-world interactions it needs are to improve its internal model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which approach would you want for a robot surgeon? A self-driving car? A Mars rover that cannot afford a single mistake?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly why world models matter. They enable **sample-efficient learning** — achieving good performance with far fewer real-world interactions."

    "$$s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us break this down:\n",
    "- $s_t$ is the **state** at time $t$ — everything the agent knows about the world right now. In CartPole, this is a vector of 4 numbers: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole angular velocity.\n",
    "- $a_t$ is the **action** the agent takes — in CartPole, this is either 0 (push left) or 1 (push right).\n",
    "- $f$ is the **transition function** — the \"physics engine\" that determines what happens next.\n",
    "- $s_{t+1}$ is the **next state** — where the world ends up after the action.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a few minutes to think about these questions. They will deepen your understanding and prepare you for the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compounding error:** We saw that multi-step predictions diverge from reality over time. What would happen if we increased the planning horizon from 15 to 100 steps? Would the agent perform better or worse? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data distribution:** We collected training data using a *random* policy. What would happen if we trained the world model on data from a *good* policy instead? Would the model be better or worse at predicting what happens when the agent makes mistakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model capacity:** Our world model has just 2 hidden layers with 128 units. CartPole has simple physics. What would need to change if we wanted to model a more complex environment like a robotic arm with 20 joints?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 1: Improve the planner.** The random shooting planner is the simplest possible planning algorithm. Try implementing the **Cross-Entropy Method (CEM)**: instead of sampling completely random sequences, sample from a distribution, evaluate them, keep the top 10%, and refit the distribution. Repeat for 3-5 iterations. Does this improve performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge 2: Learn from imagination.** Right now, we plan at every step, which is slow. Can you use the world model to generate *synthetic training data* — imagined trajectories — and then train a simple policy network on that data? This is the core idea behind the Dyna architecture (Sutton, 1991).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coming up in Notebook 2:** We will move beyond simple feedforward models and explore how Ha and Schmidhuber's *\"World Models\"* paper (2018) used a **VAE + RNN** architecture to learn compressed, temporal world models — enabling an agent to learn entirely inside its own dream.\n",
