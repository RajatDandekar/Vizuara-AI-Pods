    "\n",
    "The Vision model does exactly this. It takes a raw observation (the full state of the environment) and compresses it into a tiny **latent vector** $z$. This vector is like a JPEG of the observation — much smaller, but it captures everything the agent needs to know.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_t, \\log \\sigma_t^2 = \\text{Encoder}(x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this says: pass the observation through a neural network that outputs two vectors — a mean $\\mu$ and a log-variance $\\log \\sigma^2$. These define a Gaussian distribution in latent space.\n",

    "**Reparameterization Trick** — sample from this distribution in a differentiable way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_t = \\mu_t + \\sigma_t \\cdot \\epsilon, \\quad \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, this says: take the mean vector, then add noise scaled by the standard deviation. We sample the noise $\\epsilon$ from a standard normal distribution. This is clever because the randomness is in $\\epsilon$ (which does not depend on any parameters), so gradients can flow through $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us plug in some numbers. Suppose our latent dimension is 2, and the encoder outputs $\\mu = [0.5, -0.3]$ and $\\sigma = [0.1, 0.2]$. We sample $\\epsilon = [1.0, -0.5]$. Then:\n",
    "\n",

    "This is exactly what we want — a sample that is close to the mean but with controlled randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoder** — reconstructs the observation from $z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{x}_t = \\text{Decoder}(z_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**VAE Loss** — balances reconstruction quality and regularization:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first term says: the reconstruction should look like the original. The second term says: the latent distribution should stay close to a standard normal — this prevents the encoder from \"cheating\" by using wildly different regions of latent space for different observations.

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about these questions before moving on to the next notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model fidelity:** The dream trajectories diverge from reality over time. Why does this happen, and what determines how quickly the dream drifts from reality? How might we improve this?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Controller simplicity:** Ha and Schmidhuber deliberately used a simple linear controller. What are the advantages of this design choice? What happens if we make the controller more complex (e.g., a deep network)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compounding errors:** In dream training, the Memory model's prediction errors compound at each step — the agent acts on a slightly wrong state, which leads to a slightly more wrong next state. How does this relate to the concept of \"distribution shift\" in machine learning? Can you think of ways to mitigate this?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase the latent dimension.** Change `latent_dim` from 2 to 8 or 16. Does the VAE reconstruct better? Does the MDN-RNN predict better? Does the agent perform better in the real environment? Plot the results for different latent dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Try a harder environment.** Replace CartPole-v1 with `MountainCar-v0` or `Acrobot-v1`. You will need to adjust the reward proxy function and possibly the network sizes. Can the World Model learn meaningful dynamics for these environments?"

    "- **Learned reward models** instead of hand-crafted reward proxies\n",
