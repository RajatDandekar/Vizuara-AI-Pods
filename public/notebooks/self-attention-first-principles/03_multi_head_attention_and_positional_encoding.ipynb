    "In the previous notebook, we built scaled dot-product attention — a mechanism that lets every word attend to every other word. But a single attention head can only learn **one** pattern. What if the word \"it\" needs to simultaneously attend to \"animal\" (coreference), \"was\" (syntax), and \"tired\" (semantics)?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. Why is the standard practice to set $d_k = d_{\\text{model}} / h$ rather than having each head use the full $d_{\\text{model}}$ dimensions? What happens to computation cost if each head uses the full dimension?\n",
    "2. Compare sinusoidal and learned positional encodings. What are the advantages of each? (Hint: think about generalization to longer sequences.)\n",
    "3. In the trained attention patterns, do different heads appear to focus on different things? What patterns can you identify?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. Implement **Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE)** — the positional encoding used in LLaMA and modern LLMs. It encodes relative position directly into the attention computation.\n",
    "2. Try training with different numbers of heads (1, 2, 4, 8) and compare the final loss. Is there a sweet spot?"
