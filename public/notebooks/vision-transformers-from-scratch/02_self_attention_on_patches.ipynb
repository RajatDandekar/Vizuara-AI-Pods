    "What would happen without it? Try removing the `/ math.sqrt(d_k)` from our attention function and see what happens to the attention weights. You should find that softmax produces nearly one-hot distributions — almost all the weight goes to a single token. This kills the ability to blend information from multiple tokens and makes gradients vanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Each attention head has its own $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$. What if all heads shared the same weights?**\n",
    "Try modifying `MultiHeadAttention` so all heads share one set of projection matrices. What happens to the diversity of attention patterns in the visualization? You should see all heads produce nearly identical patterns, losing the benefit of multi-head attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The residual connection adds the input back. What happens if you remove it?**\n",
    "Try removing the `+ x` from the Transformer block. Train or evaluate — you will likely find that the model becomes much harder to train and the representations degrade in deeper layers. Residual connections are essential for gradient flow in deep networks."
