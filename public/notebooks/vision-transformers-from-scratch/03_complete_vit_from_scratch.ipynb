Over 6 rounds of discussion (Transformer layers), the manager listens to everyone through self-attention. By the end, the manager has synthesized information from all 64 employees into a single, comprehensive summary.\n",

Each patch token can focus on encoding its local region, while `[CLS]` focuses on the big picture."

    "Our ViT-Tiny achieved ~78% on CIFAR-10. A ResNet-18 gets ~93% with similar training. Why the gap?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: **ViT has no built-in knowledge about images**. A CNN knows that nearby pixels are related (locality) and that features should work regardless of position (translation equivariance). ViT must learn all of this from data alone. With only 50,000 training images, it simply does not have enough examples to fully learn these spatial priors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would help ViT catch up?\n",
    "- **More data**: The original ViT was pre-trained on 300M images. With enough data, ViT actually surpasses CNNs.\n",
    "- **Data-efficient tricks**: DeiT showed that with strong augmentation, regularization, and knowledge distillation, ViT can be competitive on ImageNet even without massive pre-training.\n",

Over thousands of gradient updates, the position embeddings adjust to reflect these statistical patterns — which happen to encode 2D geometry. The model does not \"know\" about 2D; it just learns which positions tend to have similar content."
