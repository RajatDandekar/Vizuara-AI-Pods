    "## Section 8: Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to think about these before moving on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patch size trade-off:** What happens to the number of patches if we use 8x8 patches instead of 4x4 on our 32x32 images? We would get $(32/8)^2 = 16$ patches instead of 64. Fewer patches means a shorter sequence, which means **quadratically less computation** in self-attention (attention is $O(N^2)$). But each patch covers more of the image, so we lose fine-grained spatial detail. This is a fundamental resolution-vs-computation trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why not raw pixels?** Why do we use a learnable linear projection instead of feeding raw pixel vectors directly to the Transformer? Raw pixel values live in a space that is not aligned with the features the Transformer needs. The linear projection learns to extract useful initial features — edges, color gradients, textures — that give the Transformer a better starting representation. It is also a dimensionality change: we can project 48-dimensional raw patches into whatever dimension $D$ we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **1D vs 2D position embeddings:** Our position embeddings are 1D — one vector per position in the flattened sequence. The model has to **learn** that position 0 and position 1 are horizontally adjacent, while position 0 and position 8 are vertically adjacent. Remarkably, it does learn this! An alternative is 2D position embeddings that explicitly encode (row, column) — the original ViT paper tried this and found it performs similarly, suggesting that 1D learnable embeddings are sufficient."
