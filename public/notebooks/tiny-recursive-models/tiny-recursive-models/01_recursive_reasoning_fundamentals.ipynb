    "### Single-Pass vs Recursive Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two students taking an exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student A (Single-Pass):** Reads each question once, writes an answer immediately, and moves to the next. Never looks back. This is how most neural networks work — the input flows forward through the layers once and produces an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student B (Recursive):** Reads all the questions first, answers the easy ones, then goes back to the beginning. On the second pass, the answers from the easy questions give hints about the harder ones. On the third pass, even more becomes clear. By the fifth pass, everything falls into place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Student B uses the **same brain** on every pass. No extra neurons were grown between passes. The only thing that changed was the **information available** — each pass created new context that made the next pass easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the fundamental insight behind recursive reasoning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **You do not need a bigger brain. You need to think again.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LLMs Fail at Structured Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models like GPT-4 process input through ~100 transformer layers in a single forward pass. Each layer has **unique** weights — that is hundreds of billions of parameters, each used exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for a task like Sudoku, what matters is not how many different operations you can perform — it is how many times you can **revisit and refine** your work. A single pass, no matter how wide, cannot propagate constraints that only become visible after earlier constraints are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Think About This\n",

    "Before we write any code, consider this puzzle:\n",

    "| 3 | ? | 1 |\n",

    "## 8. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive reasoning works** because each pass creates new information that enables the next pass — constraints propagate across iterations\n",
    "2. **The same function is applied each time** — no new parameters or logic between passes, just new context from previous results\n",
    "3. **Single-pass approaches fail** on structured reasoning tasks because they cannot propagate long-range dependencies that only emerge after intermediate steps are resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What would happen if the puzzle required **backtracking** (guessing and checking)? Could pure constraint propagation handle that, or would we need a fundamentally different approach?\n",
    "2. How is constraint propagation similar to what happens inside a recursive neural network? What does the **reasoning state z** correspond to in our solver?\n",
    "3. Why do you think large language models score **0%** on extreme Sudoku despite having trillions of parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale up:** Implement constraint propagation for a full 9×9 Sudoku. How many passes does it typically need?\n",
    "2. **Backtracking:** Add a guessing mechanism — when stuck, pick the cell with fewest possibilities, guess a value, and continue. If it leads to a contradiction, backtrack. This is closer to how the neural model handles uncertainty.\n",
    "3. **Visualize z:** Create a heatmap that shows how the \"uncertainty\" (number of possibilities per cell) decreases with each pass. This is a direct analog of how the latent reasoning state z evolves in TRM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we will build the actual **Tiny Recursive Model** neural network from scratch — replacing our hand-coded constraint propagation with a learned function that discovers its own reasoning strategy."
