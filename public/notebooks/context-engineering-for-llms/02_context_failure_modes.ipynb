    "## 8. Reflection 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us step back and think about what we have built and learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built\n",
    "1. **Context quality metrics** — TF-IDF similarity and signal-to-noise ratio to measure context health\n",
    "2. **Four failure mode simulators** — each one demonstrates a real, documented failure pattern\n",
    "3. **Three detection functions** — poisoning detection, confusion scoring, and clash detection\n",
    "4. **A Context Health Checker** — a reusable diagnostic tool that combines all four checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Four Failure Modes — Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Failure Mode | What Goes Wrong | Real-World Example | Our Detection |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Poisoning** | False facts compound over turns | Gemini Pokemon agent | TF-IDF fact verification |\n",
    "| **Distraction** | Key info lost in long context | \"Lost in the Middle\" (Liu 2023) | Position-based risk scoring |\n",
    "| **Confusion** | Irrelevant noise drowns signal | Llama 3.1 fails at 46 tools | Relevance fraction scoring |\n",
    "| **Clash** | Contradictory instructions | o3 drops from 98% to 64% | Pairwise similarity detection |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More is not always better.** More context, more tools, more instructions — all can make models *worse*, not better. Context engineering is as much about what you *exclude* as what you include.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Position matters.** Where you place information in the context affects whether the model can find it. Put the most important information first.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Errors compound.** A single hallucination does not just add one wrong answer — it generates derivative errors that accumulate over turns. Validate context entries against ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contradictions are catastrophic.** Fragmenting or contradicting instructions causes disproportionate damage. Unified, consistent instructions dramatically outperform scattered ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3 of this series, we will learn the **four core strategies** for engineering context well — Write, Select, Compress, and Isolate — and build tools that implement each one. If this notebook taught you what can go wrong, the next one teaches you how to get it right."
