    "- $m$ is the number of PRM evaluations\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ (default 1) balances outcome vs step-wise signals\n",

    "Computationally: the integrated reward augments the binary outcome with fine-grained step scores. A step that was individually good ($S > 0$) in a failed task ($O = -1$) gets a less harsh penalty than a step that was individually bad.\n",

    "$$R_{S_{\\tau_i, j}} = R_{\\tau_i} \\cdot S_{\\tau_i, j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally: if the PRM agrees with the integrated reward (both positive or both negative), it gets a positive consistency reward. If it disagrees, it gets penalized.\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. What would happen if we made the PRM too powerful (100% accurate from the start)? Would co-optimization still help?\n",
    "2. The difficulty adaptation uses fixed thresholds (80% and 20%). What would happen with tighter thresholds (e.g., 60% and 40%)? Would the system oscillate?\n",
    "3. In the real OpenClaw-RL system, the user is the \"environment\" — they generate tasks by chatting. How does this differ from our simulated environment? What challenges does this introduce?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Multi-step trajectories**: Extend the system to handle multi-step tasks where each step has its own integrated reward.\n",
    "2. **PRM ensemble**: Instead of one PRM, train multiple PRMs and use their agreement as an additional signal.\n",
    "3. **Catastrophic forgetting**: Add a regularization term that prevents the policy from forgetting old skills while learning new preferences."
