    "Let us think about what happens in a typical conversation with an AI assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "You ask something. The model responds. Then you react to that response.\n",
    "\n",
    "That reaction — your next message — is incredibly informative:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Great, exactly what I needed!\"** → The model did well. Positive signal.\n",
    "- **\"No, I meant the other thing.\"** → The model misunderstood. Negative signal with direction.\n",
    "- **\"Can you also add error handling?\"** → The model did okay, but there is room for improvement. Neutral/mildly positive signal.\n",
    "- **\"That code has a bug on line 3.\"** → Specific negative signal with a precise correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **next-state signal** idea. In traditional reinforcement learning, we need a separate reward function to tell the agent how well it did. In OpenClaw-RL, the reward is already there — embedded naturally in the conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not every message in a conversation is useful for training. Some messages are:\n",
    "- System messages or metadata\n",
    "- The user asking for clarification (not reacting to a response)\n",
    "- Tool calls or function results\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to classify each turn and extract only the useful training pairs.\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. What happens if a user asks a completely new question (changes topic) instead of providing feedback on the assistant's response? Should that be treated as a next-state signal?\n",
    "2. In OpenClaw-RL, the rollout collector runs **asynchronously** — it processes conversations while the model continues serving. What challenges does this introduce?\n",
    "3. We used simple keyword matching for sentiment classification. In the full system, a PRM (Process Reward Model) handles this. What advantages would a learned model have over keywords?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Handle tool calls**: Extend the turn classifier to handle conversations that include tool calls (e.g., the assistant calling a calculator or web search).\n",
    "2. **Sliding window context**: For very long conversations, implement a sliding window that keeps only the last N turns as context.\n",
    "3. **Session splitting**: Implement logic to split a single long conversation into multiple sessions when the user changes topic."
