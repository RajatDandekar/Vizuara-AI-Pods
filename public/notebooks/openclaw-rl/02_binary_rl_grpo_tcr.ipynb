    "\n",
    "For each (response, next-state) pair, the PRM runs $m$ evaluations and produces votes $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_m \\in \\{-1, 0, +1\\}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, with $m = 5$ votes: $[+1, +1, -1, +1, 0]$. Count: three +1, one -1, one 0. The majority is +1, so $r = +1$.\n",

    "### 3.2 Group-Relative Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $G$ responses to the same prompt with rewards $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_G$, the normalized advantage is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Computationally: subtract the group mean from each reward, then divide by the standard deviation. This centers the advantages around zero, so the model knows which responses were above average and which were below.\n",

    "\n",

    "Computationally: we compute how much the new policy differs from the old one at each token. If it changed too much (ratio too high or too low), the clip mechanism prevents the update from being too aggressive. This keeps training stable.\n",

    "1. Why does asymmetric clipping (clip-higher) help with exploration? What would happen if $\\epsilon_{\\text{high}}$ was very large (say, 10)?\n",
    "2. The overlong reward shaping uses a linear penalty in the transition zone. What would happen with a quadratic penalty instead? Would it be better or worse?\n",
    "3. In our demo, we used synthetic rewards. In the real system, PRM rewards come from a language model. What happens if the PRM is biased (e.g., it always rates longer responses higher)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Dynamic clip bounds**: Implement a version where $\\epsilon_{\\text{high}}$ decreases over training (start exploratory, become conservative).\n",
    "2. **Reward aggregation**: Instead of simple majority voting, implement weighted voting where more confident PRM evaluations count more.\n",
    "3. **Group size ablation**: Run the training loop with different group sizes (G=2, 4, 8, 16) and compare convergence speed."
