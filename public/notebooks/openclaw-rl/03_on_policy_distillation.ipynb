    "\n",
    "$$h = \\text{Judge}(f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- $f$ = \"No, I said Python not JavaScript\" → $h$ = \"Use Python instead of JavaScript\"\n",
    "- $f$ = \"That is too verbose, be more concise\" → $h$ = \"Keep the response short and direct\"\n",

    "The enhanced prompt concatenates the original prompt with the hint:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us work through a concrete example. At token position $t$:\n",
    "- Teacher (with hint) assigns log-prob = $-0.5$ to \"Python\"\n",
    "- Student (without hint) assigns log-prob = $-2.3$ to \"Python\"\n",
    "- $A_t = -0.5 - (-2.3) = 1.8$ → Strong signal: \"increase the probability of this token\"\n",

    "- Teacher assigns $-1.2$, Student assigns $-1.0$\n",
    "- $A_t = -1.2 - (-1.0) = -0.2$ → Tiny signal: \"student was already fine here\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 OPD Loss\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "1. In OPD, the teacher and student are the **same model**. What would happen if we used a much larger model as the teacher? Would that be better or worse?\n",
    "2. The hint quality filter discards short hints. Can you think of a case where a very short hint is still highly informative? (e.g., \"Python\" as a hint)\n",
    "3. OPD requires computing log-probabilities twice (once for teacher, once for student). How could we reduce this compute cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏆 Optional Challenges\n",
    "1. **Weighted token advantages**: Instead of raw $A_t = \\log \\pi_{\\text{teacher}} - \\log \\pi_{\\text{student}}$, implement a version where advantages are weighted by the teacher's confidence.\n",
    "2. **Adaptive hint selection**: Instead of always keeping the longest hint, implement a scoring function that balances hint length with specificity.\n",
    "3. **Mixed training**: Implement a training loop that alternates between Binary RL steps (for samples without hints) and OPD steps (for samples with hints)."
