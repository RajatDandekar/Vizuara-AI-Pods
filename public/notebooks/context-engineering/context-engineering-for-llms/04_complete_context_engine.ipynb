    "\n",
    "**Strategy 1 — Write (Persist Outside the Window)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are studying for an exam. You cannot memorize every single fact from a 500-page textbook. Instead, you write flashcards. The knowledge lives *outside your head* (outside the context window) but is available whenever you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world example: Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` file. Instead of re-explaining project conventions every message, the agent writes them to a persistent file and reads them back when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy 2 — Select (Retrieve Just-in-Time)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are in a library with 10,000 books. You do not carry all of them to your desk. You check the catalog, find the 3 books relevant to your current research question, and fetch only those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world example: Cursor's `@`-references let users manually select which files to include. Claude Code's `glob`/`grep` tools let the agent discover context lazily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy 3 — Compress (Summarize and Compact)**\n",
    "\n",
    "After a 2-hour meeting, you do not transcribe every word. You write bullet-point notes capturing the key decisions, action items, and unresolved questions. The 50-page transcript becomes 1 page of notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world example: Claude Code's auto-compact triggers at 95% capacity — it summarizes conversation history, clears verbose tool outputs, and keeps only the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy 4 — Isolate (Sub-Agent Architectures)**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a project manager. Instead of personally reading every document, you assign each team member a specific task: \"Alice, summarize the backend architecture. Bob, review the test coverage. Carol, check the deployment config.\" Each person works with a clean, focused context and reports back a concise summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world example: Anthropic's multi-agent researcher splits research across sub-agents, each with its own context window, and collects condensed results."

    "## 8. Reflection and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write** is the simplest strategy but prevents costly repetition. Claude Code's `CLAUDE.md` is a production example. Even saving 5 project facts eliminates hundreds of tokens of redundant conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select** delivers the largest single-strategy savings. Loading 3 files instead of 15 cuts document tokens by 80%. The key insight: maintain a cheap index, fetch content just-in-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compress** is essential for long sessions. Conversation history grows linearly with time. TF-IDF extractive summarization keeps the signal (architectural decisions, bug reports) and discards the noise (greetings, confirmations). Clearing tool results alone can save thousands of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Isolate** shines on parallelizable tasks. Instead of one agent drowning in 15 files, three sub-agents each process 2-3 files and return compact summaries. Anthropic's multi-agent researcher demonstrated that isolation improves both quality and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The strategies compound.** Each strategy targets a different part of the context budget. Write handles memory, Select handles documents, Compress handles history, Isolate handles complexity. Together, they can reduce context usage by 60-80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your own projects, which strategy would give you the **biggest immediate win**? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Claude Code auto-compacts at 95% capacity. Why 95% and not 50%? What is the tradeoff between compacting early vs late?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Isolate strategy works best for \"read-only\" tasks (research, analysis). Why might it be dangerous for \"write\" tasks (code editing, file creation)?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Could you build a context engine that **learns** the optimal budget allocation over time? What signal would you use to tune the percentages?"
