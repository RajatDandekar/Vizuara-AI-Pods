    "\n",
    "**Why these choices:**\n",
    "- **Learning rate 3e-5:** Small enough to preserve pre-trained knowledge, large enough to adapt to clinical text. The original BERT paper recommends 2e-5 to 5e-5 for fine-tuning.\n",
    "- **AdamW over SGD:** AdamW handles the sparse gradients in NER well (most tokens are O, so gradients are sparse). It also decouples weight decay from the adaptive learning rate.\n",
    "- **Linear warmup:** Prevents large early updates that could destroy pre-trained features. The model gradually \"wakes up\" to the new task.\n",

    "In this notebook, you built a complete clinical NER pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data exploration**: Analyzed the BC5CDR biomedical NER dataset and understood its class imbalance and entity distributions\n",
    "2. **Tokenization alignment**: Solved the critical problem of aligning word-level NER labels with BERT's subword tokens\n",
    "3. **Dictionary baseline**: Built a rule-based NER system (similar to MedScribe's legacy system) and quantified its limitations\n",
    "4. **BERT NER model**: Constructed a BERT-based token classifier from scratch (not using a pre-built class)\n",
    "5. **Fine-tuning**: Trained the model with careful hyperparameter choices to prevent catastrophic forgetting\n",
    "6. **Evaluation**: Compared BERT against the baseline with entity-level F1 and per-type analysis\n",
    "7. **Error analysis**: Categorized model failures to understand where clinical risk lies\n",
    "8. **Latency profiling**: Verified the model meets MedScribe's 500ms inference budget\n",
    "9. **Ethics assessment**: Tested for demographic bias, calibration, and clinical error severity\n",
    "\n",
    "For next steps, read **Section 4** of the case study document (Production and System Design Extension) to understand how this model would be deployed at scale across MedScribe's 12 hospital clients, including API design, monitoring, drift detection, and A/B testing."
