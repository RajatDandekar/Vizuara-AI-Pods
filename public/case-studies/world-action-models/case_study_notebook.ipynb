   "source": "## Summary\n\nIn this notebook, you built a simplified version of the NovaPick world model + VLA system for autonomous pick-and-place:\n\n1. **Data (3.1-3.2):** Loaded and explored 15K robot manipulation episodes from DROID and Open X-Embodiment, implementing paired RGB-D augmentation that preserves spatial correspondence.\n\n2. **Baseline (3.3):** Implemented a ResNet-18 + MLP grasp prediction baseline -- no language, no temporal reasoning, no world model. This establishes the performance floor.\n\n3. **Model (3.4):** Built the three core components:\n   - **ObservationEncoder** -- DINOv2 + CLIP with cross-attention fusion for grounded visual understanding\n   - **RSSM** -- deterministic + stochastic state-space model for predicting grasp outcomes in latent space\n   - **FlowMatchingActionHead** -- conditional flow model generating smooth 16-step action chunks\n\n4. **Training (3.5):** Implemented the composite training loop with flow matching loss, RSSM KL loss, and grasp prediction loss, using AdamW with cosine LR schedule.\n\n5. **Evaluation (3.6):** Tested the model in PyBullet simulation on both known and novel objects, measuring pick success rate, cycle time, smoothness, and collision rate.\n\n6. **Error Analysis (3.7):** Categorized failures into 5 modes (grasp slip, miss, wrong object, collision, timeout) and identified object properties correlated with each failure type.\n\n7. **Deployment (3.8):** Benchmarked inference latency per component to validate the 200ms latency target on an NVIDIA L4 GPU.\n\n8. **Ethics (3.9):** Analyzed labor displacement, safety, bias, environmental impact, and dual-use concerns.\n\n**Key takeaway:** The world model enables \"mental rehearsal\" -- predicting grasp outcomes before physical execution -- while the VLA architecture with flow matching generates smooth, language-conditioned trajectories that generalize zero-shot to novel objects. This combination transforms pick-and-place from a per-SKU engineering problem into a general-purpose learned capability.\n\nFor the full case study including production system design, see `case_study.md` in this directory.",
