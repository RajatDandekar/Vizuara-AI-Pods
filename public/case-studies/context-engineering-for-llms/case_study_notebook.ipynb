In this notebook, you will build a complete context engineering pipeline for a legal research assistant, progressing from data exploration through a fully evaluated retrieval-augmented generation system.\n",

    "- A complete evaluation framework comparing your pipeline against a BM25 baseline\n",

    "**Thought Questions:**\n",
    "1. If BriefEngine's retrieval disproportionately surfaces cases from eras with discriminatory legal reasoning (e.g., pre-civil-rights decisions), how could this perpetuate injustice? How would you detect and mitigate this?\n",
    "2. Should an AI legal research tool tell the attorney that a particular argument it generated is \"strong\" or \"weak\"? What are the risks of the AI expressing confidence in legal conclusions?\n",
    "3. BriefEngine operates under attorney-client privilege. What technical measures must be in place to ensure that one firm's case data never leaks into another firm's context?\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you built a complete context engineering pipeline for a legal research assistant. Here is what you implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Acquisition**: Loaded and chunked a corpus of legal opinions with metadata preservation\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyzed the corpus structure, identifying key distributions and potential challenges\n",
    "3. **Baseline**: Implemented BM25 keyword search as a performance floor\n",
    "4. **Query Analysis**: Parsed attorney inputs into structured queries with jurisdiction filters (Select strategy)\n",
    "5. **Filtered Retrieval**: Applied hard metadata filters to prevent irrelevant documents from entering the pipeline (Select strategy)\n",
    "6. **Semantic Search + Reranking**: Used embeddings and cross-encoders for relevance ranking (Select strategy)\n",
    "7. **Context Assembly**: Built a ContextEngine that allocates token budgets and structures context with XML tags (all four strategies)\n",
    "8. **Citation Verification**: Created a persistent validity index to catch bad citations (Write strategy)\n",
    "9. **Fine-tuning**: Trained the embedding model on legal domain data using InfoNCE contrastive loss\n",
    "10. **Evaluation**: Compared the full pipeline against the baseline across multiple metrics\n",
    "11. **Error Analysis**: Categorized failures into the four context failure modes\n",
    "12. **Profiling**: Measured latency per pipeline stage and identified optimization opportunities\n",
    "13. **Ethics**: Analyzed temporal bias and wrote an ethical impact assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: The quality of an LLM's output is bounded by the quality of its context. By applying the four context engineering strategies (Write, Select, Compress, Isolate) systematically, you transformed a naive keyword-search pipeline into a precise, jurisdiction-aware, citation-verified legal research system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**: Read Section 4 (Production and System Design Extension) of the case study document for a detailed look at how this pipeline would operate at scale in BriefEngine's production environment, including API design, monitoring, A/B testing, and cost analysis."
