    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you built a complete World Model system for autonomous navigation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection** -- Gathered rollout data from the environment (50,000 frames vs. 10M for model-free RL)\n",
    "2. **Vision (V)** -- Trained a VAE to compress 64x64 images into 32-dimensional latent codes (384:1 compression)\n",
    "3. **Memory (M)** -- Trained an MDN-RNN to predict multiple possible futures as mixtures of Gaussians\n",
    "4. **Controller (C)** -- Trained a 867-parameter linear controller entirely inside learned \"dreams\" using CMA-ES\n",
    "5. **Evaluation** -- Compared the dream-trained agent against a rule-based baseline in the real environment\n",
    "6. **Error Analysis** -- Identified and categorized failure modes for deployment safety\n",
    "7. **Deployment** -- Profiled inference latency against the 100ms production budget\n",
    "8. **Ethics** -- Assessed the societal implications of deploying dream-trained autonomous robots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway**: The world model achieves comparable performance to model-free methods while using 200x fewer real-world interactions. The agent literally learns to drive by dreaming -- a paradigm that slashes FleetPath's warehouse onboarding cost from \\$928,000 to under \\$3,000.\n",
